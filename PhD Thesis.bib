	doi = {10.2534/jjasnaoe.24.167},
	abstract = {Ship manoeuvrability has been generally predicted based on 3-{DOF} mathematical model. However, medium-high speed ships such as containerships and passenger ferries make sometimes a large roll motion by the steering, which more or less affects on the ship manoeuvrability. Although a lot of researches have been done about the effect of roll motion, the mathematical models of hydrodynamic forces have been proposed individually putting the additional terms of roll angle into the conventional 3-{DOF} mathematical model. This makes the difficulty in the prediction of manoeuvrability.
In this paper, the captive model tests have been performed with a container ship and a passenger ferry. In order to grasp the characteristics of the effect of roll angle on the conventional 3-{DOF} mathematical model, {CMT}(Circular Motion Test) have been carried out with setting a constant roll angles. And then, the effects of roll angle on the hydrodynamic derivatives have been extracted. From this analysis, the suitable 4-{DOF} mathematical model has been introduced by means of eliminating the less contributing terms of the roll effect. For the validation of the proposed mathematical model, free running model tests were carried out with several {GM} and ship’s speed since the roll angle during a manoeuvring is affected by them. After comparing simulated results by the proposed 4-{DOF} mathematical model and the results of free running model test, it is found that the effect of {GM} and ship’s speed on turning trajectories or the overshoot of Z-test can be well predicted by the proposed 4-{DOF} mathematical model.},

	abstract = {We present a modular mathematical model and a reference technique for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single- and twin-screw propulsion ships. Heave, roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non-linear unified seakeeping/maneuvering time-domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6–{DoF} model in the form of critical damping and natural period. Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel’s waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, {CFD} or model test data. Results are validated against experiments available for zig-zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations. It is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneu­ vering trajectories of existing or new-build vessels and for estimating the evasive velocity in way of contact before grounding.},

The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong ‘destabilizing’ yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels—promotion of flow separation—can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.},

	abstract = {Maritime autonomous surface ships ({MASS}) require accurate future state projection to initiate collision-avoidance manoeuvres. Forecasts of the vessels’ trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the mathematical manoeuvring model, which is an essential component of their hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship {KCS} as an object of study, this paper adopts a 4-{DOF} modular-type manoeuvring ({MMG}) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential ﬂow solver {WASIM}, which is based on Rankine panel method. The computed vessel trajectories and motions are compared with available literature results and show good correlation.},

These methods have limitations to taking into account the viscous effects in estimating the roll motion, while, {CFD} as a numerical method is capable of considering the viscous effects. In this study, a {CFD} method based on a harmonic excited roll motion ({HERM}) technique is used to compute the roll motion and the roll damping moment of a containership’s model in different conditions. The inﬂuence of excitation frequency, forward speed and degrees of freedom at beam-sea and oblique-sea realizations are considered in estimating the roll damping coefﬁcients.

However, experimental data on roll damping of inland vessels are scarce and unreliable. Thus the applicability of classic Ikeda’s method and its simplified version on typical European inland vessels is investigated, with specific focus on eddy making component. It is found that the simplified Ikeda’s method, in comparison to the classic method, may considerably underestimate the eddy making component of damping of full hull forms, or even return negative values, although the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability.

	title = {Parameter identification of nonlinear ship maneuvering model using support vector machine method},
	abstract = {Demanding marine operations increases the complexity of maneuvering. A highly accurate dynamic ship model
permits predicting ship motions and therefore advancing control safety and maneuverability for the offshore ship
system. To adequately simulate the maneuvering motion of a real vessel, it is crucial to identify the uncertain
hydrodynamic coefficients to establish highly accurate mathematical models. In this paper, a support vector machine
method is proposed for the hydrodynamic parameter identification of a nonlinear maneuvering model for a surface
vessel. To improve the stability and generalization performance of the identification model, multiple zigzag
maneuvering datasets are included as training data. The 3-{DOF} hydrodynamic derivatives are identified and
validated by the multiple support vector regression model. The generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear
model is explored by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the original maneuvering data on the
evaluation dataset, a dataset that contains separate variable zigzag and turning circle maneuvers tests. The
satisfactory agreements between predicted motions and original motions demonstrate the validity and generalization
capability of the proposed parameter identification method.},

The experimental data as well should be set-up in an input file. The benchmark automatically creates input files for the chosen manoeuvring software, runs the software and manages the output files. It reads from these outputs, collects the model test measurements and plots the results. Some test-cases are presented in the paper, showing the potentialities and flexibility of the benchmark. To this purpose a manoeuvring prediction program is used as example and its theory briefly explained. Its simulations are then compared with the benchmark of experimental data.},

	abstract = {In many situations the manoeuvering performance of ships is largely effected by the non-linear contributions of the hydrodynamic reaction forces on the hull. The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.},

Application of the algorithm to a set of simulated data has proved to be quite successful.

Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial {RANS} solver based on a finite volume method ({FVM}) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using {VOF} (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with {URANS} approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz’s non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature. In addition, viscous effects have been investigated using Eulerian approach for several static drift cases.},

Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible.

Fitting the validation data to 80\% for short-term prediction and 65\% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to ﬁt the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identiﬁcation procedure is proposed. In the ﬁrst step a predictive linear model is identiﬁed conventionally, and then coefﬁcients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefﬁcient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100\% of their values to approximately 5\% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71\% and 54\% to 89\% and 76\%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufﬁciently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.},

Despite its short computation time, system-based simulations need many captive model tests to estimate the hydrodynamic and rudder maneuvering coefficients used in the system-based mathematical model and the results have difficulty to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental data. Herein system identification techniques (extended Kalman filtering and constrained least square method using generalized reduced gradient algorithm) are used to predict the maneuvering coefficients from several {EFD}, systems based and {CFD} free-running trials. {CFD} gives not only the ship motions but also the total and component hydrodynamic forces/moments during the free-running simulations, which is helpful for estimating the maneuvering coefficients. Several types of free-running (turning circle, zigzag and large angle zigzag) tests are conducted using {EFD} and {CFD} to examine which free-running trial gives the best maneuvering coefficients using system identification. Also several free-running data are combined together for parallel processing. The set of maneuvering coefficients estimated by the constrained least square method using combined {CFD} free-running trial data show the most generalized results which covers a wide range of maneuvers.},

Certain maritime regulations are not applicable to {USVs} and must be changed. The key technologies in the current development of {USVs} are being investigated. While the level of intelligence is improving, the protection of cargo cannot be neglected.

An inverse problem was formulated to solve the first-kind Volterra-type integral equation using sets of motion signal data. However, this numerical approach leads to solution instability due to noisy data. Regularization is a technique that can overcome the lack of stability; hence, Landweber’s regularization method was employed in this study. The L-curve criterion was used to select regularization parameters (number of iterations) that correspond to the accuracy of the inverse solution. The solution of this method is a discrete moment, which is the summation of nonlinear restoring, nonlinear damping, and nonlinear mass moment of inertia. A zero-crossing detection technique is used in the nonparametric system identification method on a pair of measured data of the angular velocity and angular acceleration of a ship, and the detections are matched with the inverse solution at the same discrete times. The procedure was demonstrated through a numerical model of a full nonlinear free-roll motion system in still water to examine and prove its accuracy. Results show that the method effectively and efficiently identified the functional form of the nonlinear added moment of inertia and damping moment.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the predictability limit of day-to-day weather phenomena such as midlatitude winter storms and summer monsoonal rainstorms is crucial to numerical weather prediction ({NWP}). This predictability limit is studied using unprecedented high-resolution global models with ensemble experiments of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ({ECMWF}; 9-km operational model) and identical-twin experiments of the U.S. Next-Generation Global Prediction System ({NGGPS}; 3 km). Results suggest that the predictability limit for midlatitude weather may indeed exist and is intrinsic to the underlying dynamical system and instabilities even if the forecast model and the initial conditions are nearly perfect. Currently, a skillful forecast lead time of midlatitude instantaneous weather is around 10 days, which serves as the practical predictability limit. Reducing the current-day initial-condition uncertainty by an order of magnitude extends the deterministic forecast lead times of day-to-day weather by up to 5 days, with much less scope for improving prediction of small-scale phenomena like thunderstorms. Achieving this additional predictability limit can have enormous socioeconomic benefits but requires coordinated efforts by the entire community to design better numerical weather models, to improve observations, and to make better use of observations with advanced data assimilation and computing techniques.},

First, a general data pre-processing framework is presented. The different machine learning based models are trained by both ship operational parameters and encountered metocean conditions. Based on the full-scale measurement data collected at two types of worldwide sailing ships, the pros and cons of different machine learning algorithms for the ship’s speed–power performance modeling are compared. Finally, the best performed {XGboost} model is chosen to analyze the sensitivity due to the amount of available ship data, assumed time period for each stationary waypoint (data sample) used for the model training, and their impact on online performance prediction.},

To that end, the paper identifies the steps in the {SDT} formulation process and methods used in each step of the process. Furthermore, a four-step iterative procedure for the {SDT} development is proposed. The applications of the concept are numerous, and some of them are presented in a review analysis in this paper.

	abstract = {Digital Twins have much attention in the shipping industry, attempting to support all phases of a vessel’s life cycle. With several tools appearing in Digital Twin software suites, high-quality manoeuvring and performance prediction remain cornerstones. Propulsion efficiency is in focus while in service. Simulator-based training is in focus to ensure safety of manoeuvring in confined waters and harbours. Prediction of ships’ velocity and turn rate are essential for correct look and feel during training, but phenomena like dynamic inflow to propellers, bank and shallow water effects limit simulators’ accuracy, and master mariners often comment that simulations could be in better agreement with actual behaviours of their vessel. This paper focuses on digital twin enhancements to better match reality. Using data logged during in-service operation, we first consider a system identification perspective, employing a first-principles model structure. Showing that a complete first-principles model is not identifiable under the excitation met in service, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to predict deviations between measured velocities and the model output. The outcome is a hybrid of a first-principles model with a machine learning generic approximator add-on. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy of both in-harbour manoeuvring and shallow water passage conditions.},

Indicative examples in this category are advanced applications like Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), Big Data Analytics ({BDA}), Cloud Computing and Internet of Things ({IoT}), which are already influencing the maritime industry. It is indicative of the fact that there are several construction projects of autonomous ships, such as the Yara Birkeland and the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship ({ASDS}), which are heavily reliant on technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept.

Examining those visions and strategies in relation to digitalization would be beneficial to better understand the way towards which the maritime industry is heading. This paper is aiming to identify the characteristics of that pool of future plans via a qualitative review and with a particular focus on major maritime commercial actors, based on shipping companies' relevant action plans that were gathered online.

	abstract = {Virtual prototypes ({VPs}) are digital models that mock-up existing or conceptual systems' behaviour. In offshore operations, {VPs} find usages in design, proof of concept for new equipment or method, control system testing, procedure planning, and expert crew training. Moreover, {VP} can be used in full mission simulators with crews of maritime and offshore engineers, in which case they integrate with control systems such as handles and dynamic positioning systems. Putting the human in the loop sets high requirements for the fidelity of the visual 3D-models and the mathematical models' validity. {VPs} are thus time-consuming to create and difficult to validate, even based on an existing offshore system. This paper presents an innovative framework for rapid virtual prototyping of ships for hardware and human in the loop simulations and validates the results with data gathered in a sea trial performed on a research vessel, with satisfying results for position keeping.

	abstract = {While in aerospace and automotive industry, airplanes and cars are built in quantity, in maritime industry ships and offshore platforms are built uniquely such that even sister ships can be significantly different from each other. Hence, building a full scale prototype to test, verify, and demonstrate effectiveness of new innovative solutions, is not an option in maritime sector. Model testing and simulation of separate modules have been practiced in many applications successfully, however, capturing the complete interaction of different modules in a maritime system is not straight forward. To best of our knowledge, the modeling and simulation of a maritime system to the extent where the complete system, including the mutual interactions, is not accomplished yet. A maritime system incorporates a wide variety of components from different engineering fields and in order to develop a simulation framework for such a complex system, an interdisciplinary effort is needed from different branches of science including but not limited to hydrodynamics, machinery and power systems, structural engineering, navigation and control. This paper aims to introduce a joint effort from different research institutes, universities, and industrial partners to shed a light on the different issues in virtual prototyping in maritime systems and operations. It summarizes some of the available frameworks for virtual prototyping, and ends with a numerical simulation of a generic hull model coupled with propellers, propeller actuators, {DP} controller, thrust loss calculations, wind, waves and current, performed with the current implementation of our Virtual Prototyping Framework ({VPF}).},

Two efficient Bayesian models, conjugate regression and semi-conjugate regression, are adopted for hydrodynamic parameter identification. To obtain other prior parameters, the Bayesian optimization ({BO}) algorithm is introduced in the Bayesian regression model. By using the identified model and an experimental model based on Blanke's nonlinear four-degrees-of-freedom (4-{DOF}) model, 10°/10° zigzag motion and 35° turning circle manoeuvring are performed. A comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates that both Bayesian regression models have good generalization ability for identification, and that the conjugate Bayesian model has greater prediction accuracy.},

Accurate and efficient simulation models are needed to achieve maximum energy efficiency. In this paper a grey-box modeling approach for the simulation of ocean vessels is presented. The modeling approach combines conventional analysis models based on physical principles (a white-box model) with a feed forward neural-network (a black-box model). Two different ways of combining these models are presented, in series and in parallel. The results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey-box modeling approach, both serial and parallel approaches, can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white-box model. However, a prediction of the vessel speed is only improved slightly. Furthermore, the results give an indication of the potential advantages of grey-box models, which is extrapolation beyond a given training data set and the incorporation of physical phenomena which are not modeled in the white-box models. Finally, included is a discussion on how to enhance the predictability of the grey-box models as well as updating the neural-network in real-time.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing use of virtual prototyping tools in the motorcycle industry, aimed at reducing the development time of new models and speeding up performance optimization, by providing the designer with an in-laboratory virtual test track. Virtual prototyping software are multibody simulation software, which require the availability of models of all the vehicle components. The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modeling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior. In this paper, a grey-box model of a racing motorcycle mono-tube shock absorber is proposed, which consists of a nonlinear parametric model and a black-box, neural-network-based model. The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and validated against experimental test data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the real behavior of the shock absorber with an accuracy that matches or even beats that of other models previously presented in the literature. The interfacing of the proposed model to the {ADAMS} virtual prototyping environment is also discussed.},

	abstract = {This thesis is an overview of added resistance in waves, available methods and how a simplified method
can be developed.
Added resistance in waves is indeed a very complicated problem. The present methods, most of them
developed during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following
waves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these
cases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions.
In this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman’s method and Boese’s method to calculate added resistance is
implemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The
implementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These
evaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using
Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method.
This thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed.
This simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended
to be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship
design. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip
calculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency
and spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical
results from Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method. The simplified method has an accuracy of about 25\%,
which is about the same amount that usually can be expected of a method to calculate added resistance in
waves.},

To solve the problem caused by noise, the input noisy Gaussian Process ({NIGP}) model is employed, and it can automatically propagate the input uncertainty to the output in the learning model using the Taylor approxi­ mation. Polluted simulation datasets obtained from the numerical model of a parametric container ship are used for training. Zigzag and turning circle maneuvering motions are performed, and a comparison with {GP} and {SVM} is implemented to validate the proposed approach.

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {Ship maneuvering models are the keys to the research of ship maneuverability, design of ship motion control system and development of ship handling simulators. For various frames of ship maneuvering models, determining the parameters of the models is always a tedious task. System identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models by the system’s input data and output data. In this paper, based on the analysis of ship hydrodynamics, a nonlinear model frame of ship maneuvering is established. System identification theory is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. An algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter theory is proposed to calculate the parameters. In order to gain the system’s input and output data, which is necessary for the parameters identification experiment, turning circle tests and Zig-zag tests are performed on shiphandling simulator and the initial data is collected. Based on the Fixed Interval Kalman Smoothing algorithm, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed to process the raw data of the tests. With this algorithm, the errors introduced during the measurement process are eliminated. Parameters identification experiments are designed to estimate the model parameters, and the ship maneuvering model parameters estimation algorithm is extended to modify the parameters being estimated. Then the model parameters and the ship maneuvering model are determined. Simulation validation was carried out to simulate the ship maneuverability. Comparisons have been made to the simulated data and measured data. The results show that the ship maneuvering model determined by our approach can seasonably reflect the actual motion of ship, and the parameter estimation procedure and algorithms are effective.},

After well designed and trained, the selected neural network model is evaluated by the prediction results of ship maneuvers in comparison with the experimental data.

The purpose of the workshop was to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship maneuvering simulation methods including systems- and {CFD}-based methods through systematic quantitative comparisons and validation against {EFD} data for tanker ({KVLCC}), container ship ({KCS}), and surface combatant (5415) hull form test cases. For the {KVLCC} test case, two stern shape variants named {KVLCC}1 and {KVLCC}2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and {CFD} for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided {PMM} and {CMT} data, and two used {CFD} instead. {CFD}-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with {PMM}/{CMT} model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as {PMM}- and {CMT}-based methods, {CFD} based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different {CFD}-based methods such as {RANS}, {URANS}, and {DES}. This paper gives an overview of hulls, model tests, test cases, submissions, comparison results as well as the most important observations and conclusions.},

	abstract = {To predict the manoeuvrability of unmanned marine vehicle and improve its manoeuvrability, the parameters of the manoeuvring model of unmanned marine vehicle need to be obtained. Aiming at the inconvenience of obtaining model parameters under the traditional experimental method, this article studies the parameter identification of unmanned marine vehicle’s manoeuvring model based on extended Kalman filter and support vector machine. Firstly, the second-order nonlinear manoeuvring response model of unmanned marine vehicle is discretized by the difference method, and the corresponding data are collected by the manoeuvring motion simulation of the response model. Secondly, the discrete response model is transformed into an augmented state vector based on extended Kalman filter, and the optimal estimation of the state vector is calculated to identify the parameters. And then, the discrete response model is transformed into a support vector machine-based regression model, the collected data are processed and a set of support vectors are obtained to further identify the parameters of the response model. Finally, by comparing the simulation experiments’ results from the original model and the identification model, the recognition results-based extended Kalman filter and support vector machine are analysed and some research results are obtained. The results of this article will provide a powerful reference for the design of unmanned marine vehicle’s motion control algorithm.},

	abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method ({RLS}), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines ({SVM}), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for {SVM} to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using {RLS} and {SVM}‐{RLS}, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from {RLS} and {SVM}‐{RLS} have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for {SVM} positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, {SVM}‐{RLS} using data de‐noised by {EMD} shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

A Mariner Class vessel is taken as the study object. The time series used in training and testing the network is the simulated data of a series of maneuvers, which is obtained by numerically solving the Abkowitz model using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. A three-layer neural network is built to solve this multivariable regression fitting problem, and only one network model is trained to predict various ship maneuvers. Taking the mean squared error ({MSE}) as the loss function, the network’s weights are optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt ({LM}) algorithm effectively. The trained network is evaluated by several simulation tests, and it is shown that the network achieves good prediction ability and can predict the maneuvering motion as long as the control inputs and initial states of the ship motion are known.},

(2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

The analysis throughout the paper concentrates on timevarying systems, and uses the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to arrive at {RDE} and to deduce optimality of the {LQ} control gain. We now know, however, that an alternative way to prove optimality in least squares is by showing how {RDE} allows one to "complete the square" (see, e.g., [5], [18]).},

The need to track versions to accommodate for the write--review--rebut--revise life-cycle adds another layer of complexity. We propose to significantly reduce this burden by maintaining a single source document in a version-controlled environment (such as git), adding functionality to generate a collection of output formats popular in academia. To this end, we utilise various open-source tools from the Jupyter scientific computing ecosystem and operationalise selected software engineering concepts. We offer a proof-of-concept workflow that composes Jupyter Book (an online document), Jupyter Notebook (a computational narrative) and reveal.js slides from a single markdown source file. Hosted on {GitHub}, our approach supports change tracking and versioning, as well as a transparent review process based on the underlying code issue management infrastructure.

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete procedure for sensor compatibility correction of a fixed-wing Unmanned Air Vehicle ({UAV}). The sensors consist of a differential air pressure transducer for airspeed measurement, two airdata vanes installed on an airdata probe for angle of attack ({AoA}) and angle of sideslip ({AoS}) measurement, and an Attitude and Heading Reference System ({AHRS}) that provides attitude angles, angular rates, and acceleration. The procedure is mainly based on a two pass algorithm called the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ({RTS}) smoother, which consists of a forward pass Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) and a backward recursion smoother. On top of that, this paper proposes the implementation of the Wiener Type Filter prior to the {RTS} in order to avoid the complicated process noise covariance matrix estimation. Furthermore, an easy to implement airdata measurement noise variance estimation method is introduced. The method estimates the airdata and subsequently the noise variances using the ground speed and ascent rate provided by the Global Positioning System ({GPS}). It incorporates the idea of data regionality by assuming that some sort of statistical relation exists between nearby data points. Root mean square deviation ({RMSD}) is being employed to justify the sensor compatibility. The result shows that the presented procedure is easy to implement and it improves the {UAV} sensor data compatibility significantly.},

	abstract = {Small {USVs} are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system ({GNSS}) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most {USV} systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two {GNSS} antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small {USV} systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an {RTK} {GNSS} receiver is used. The drawback of the {RTK} solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) aided by {GNSS} latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground ({COG}), speed over ground ({SOG}), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a {USV}. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four {EKF} covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different {GNSS} receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the {EKF} is that the autopilot does not need to use the {COG} and {SOG} measurements from the {GNSS} receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log ({DVL}) to the {EKF} to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state {EKF} is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial {USV} systems.},

However, creating an advanced model that comprehensively represents the system and its interaction with dynamic environments has always been challenging. Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deﬁciency and improve model ﬁdelity, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel. From the ship modeling perspective, this study provides new insights by bridging the gap between two separate domains: model-based and data-driven.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear responses of ship rolling motion characterized by a roll damping moment are of great interest to naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear damping moment are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll damping moment of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in damping moment to be estimated, including its reliability analysis.},

The basis for the control system is a nonlinear maneuvering model that describes the coupled motions in surge, sway and yaw. In order to follow a predefined path, the ship must be equipped with minimum two actuators that produce a surge force and a yaw moment. Moreover, only two controls are needed to control an under actuated ship in three Degrees Of Freedom ({DOF}). Path following is achieved by a geometric assignment based on a {LOS} projection algorithm for minimization of the cross-track error to the path. The {LOS} algorithm computes heading angle commands to the autopilot system.The desired speed along the path is controlled independently of the heading autopilot. The path-following controller is model based and a nonlinear hydrodynamic model is used to derive the motion control system. A ship case study using a scale model illustrates the path-following capabilities.},

Drift of nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients is explained from the point of view of regression analysis. To diminish the multicollinearity in a complicated manoeuvring model, difference method and additional signal method are employed to reconstruct the samples. Moreover, the structure of manoeuvring model is simplified based on correlation analysis. Manoeuvring simulation is performed to demonstrate the validity of the measures proposed.},

	title = {{THESIS} {FOR} {THE} {DEGREE} {OF} {LICENTIATE} {OF} {ENGINEERING} Rigid Body Ship Dynamics System Identification in Calm Waters},
	abstract = {It is common today that operational data is recorded onboard ships within the Internet
of Ships ({IoS}) paradigm. This enables the possibility to build ship digital twins as
digital copies of the real ships. Predicting the ship’s motions with ship dynamics could
be an important sub-component of these ship digital twins. A model for the ship’s
dynamics can be identified based on observations of the ship’s motions. The identified
model will have model uncertainty due to imperfections and idealizations made in
physical model formulations as well as uncertainty from errors in the measurement
data, which can be very pronounced when using full scale operational data. It is
easier to develop accurate models with low model uncertainty using data obtained in
a controlled laboratory environment where the measurement errors are much lower,
especially in calm water conditions. The prediction model should be able to describe
scenarios that a ship has never encountered before, which is possible if much of the
underlying physics has been identified. Grey-box modelling is a technique which
combines operational data with physical principles to achieve this.
The objective of this thesis is to develop system identification methods for grey
box models with good generalization of the model scale rigid body ship dynamics in
calm waters.
A model development procedure is proposed to handle the model uncertainty
through the selection of candidate models based on a hold-out evaluation procedure.
The measurement noise is handled by an iterative preprocessor, which uses an extended
Kalman filter ({EKF}) and a Rauch Tung Striebel ({RTS}) smoother that uses an initially
estimated predictor model from semi-empirical formulas.
It is demonstrated that the ship’s roll motion with high accuracy can be described
using a quadratic damping model. For the more complex manoeuvring models,
multicollinearity is a large problem where the appropriate complexity needs to be
selected with the bias-variance trade-off between underfitting or overfitting the data.
Hold-out turning circle tests were predicted with high accuracy for the {wPCC} and
{KVLCC}2 test case ships with models from the proposed development procedure and
parameter estimation method.
The proposed methods can produce prediction models with high generalization
given that a suitable model structure has been selected from the candidate models
and an appropriate split in the hold-out evaluation of the model development process
has been applied.},

The algorithm is validated on the clean ship model and the results present good fitness with the reference. Experiments in different sea states are designed and conducted to investigate the effects of the turbulence on the identified model fidelity. Generalization results show that the models identified in the gentle and moderate environments have less than 10\% deviations and are considered allowable.

Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem , where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow ({FNPF}) method. The hybrid method is investigated using roll decay tests with the {KVLCC}2 test case. This investigation shows that the accuracy of simulated roll motions is significantly improved and also shows good agreement with the corresponding roll decay model tests.},

	abstract = {Maritime transport plays a vital role in economic development. To establish a vessel scheduling model, accurate ship maneuvering models should be used to optimize the strategy and maximize the economic beneﬁts. The use of nonparametric modeling techniques to identify ship maneuvering systems has attracted considerable attention. The Gaussian process has high precision and strong generalization ability in ﬁtting nonlinear functions and requires less training data, which is suitable for ship dynamic model identiﬁcation. Compared with other machine learning methods, the most obvious advantage of the Gaussian process is that it can provide the uncertainty of prediction. However, most studies on ship modeling and prediction do not consider the uncertainty propagation in Gaussian processes. In this paper, a moment-matching-based approach is applied to address the problem. The proposed identiﬁcation scheme for ship maneuvering systems is veriﬁed by container ship simulation data and experimental data from the Workshop on Veriﬁcation and Validation of Ship Maneuvering Simulation Methods ({SIMMAN}) database. The results indicate that the identiﬁed model is accurate and shows good generalization performance. The uncertainty of ship motion prediction is well considered based on the uncertainty propagation technology.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the fundamental properties associated with the Nomoto models. Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification. Thus, appropriate model structures can be selected according to the intended frequency range of application to meet the modeling accuracy requirements.},

Examples considered include the forecasting of the seastate elevations and vessel responses using their past time records as “explanatory variables” or “features” and the development of a nonlinear model for the roll restoring, added moment of inertia and viscous damping using the vessel response kinematics from free decay tests as “features”. A key innovation of {AI}-{SVM} kernel algorithms is that the nonlinear dependence of the dependent variable on the “features” is embedded into the {SVM} kernel and its selection plays a key role in the performance of the algorithms. The kernel selection is discussed and its relation to the physics of the marine hydrodynamic flows considered in the present paper is addressed.},

Using the method, the roll damping of various ship hulls with various bilge keels are calculated to investigate its characteristics. Ship hull forms are systematically changed by changing length, beam, draft, midship sectional coefficient and prismatic coefficient. On the basis of these predicted roll damping of various ships, a very simple prediction formula of the roll damping of ships is deduced. It is found, however, that this formula cannot be used for ships that have higher position of the center of gravity.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an experimental and numerical study on the effect of bilge keels on a specific offshore vessel. Forced roll and free decay experiments were carried out at {MARINTEK} in a joint project between {VARD}, {DNV} {GL} and {MARINTEK} during Nov. 2012. The 1:25 ship model was tested both with and without bilge keels. 19 forced roll periods were tested at 4 roll angles (2, 4, 6 and 10deg). Free decay tests were performed for initial roll angles 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15deg. Damping was extracted and compared with numerical simulations from a potential flow strip theory program ({VERES}) and a commercial {CFD} tool ({StarCCM}+). Both qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experimentally and numerically obtained damping parameters was documented. Discrepancies were identified and discussed. The three different methods of investigation gave together a basis for discussing the effect of bilge keels. From the present study, it is recommended that both experimental and numerical work in combination, for both forced roll and free decay tests, should be performed to assess the damping efficiency of bilge keels.

Starting from an experimental signal, we develop an algorithm to extract linear and quadratic damping coefficients, with information regarding the uncertainty of results. This model proves to be relevant for large scale trials, where simulated roll damping fits experimental data. Smaller-scale trials show unpredictable but reproducible phenomena and thus, a physical boundary to Froude extrapolation law. This methodology is used on four different scales (including full scale) of French frigate and also on numerical calculations.},

	volume = {218},
	doi = {10.1243/1475090041737958},
	abstract = {In this work a combined analytical-numerical approach is proposed to address the problem of the ship roll motion under the combined action of wind and waves. Roll motion is modelled as a one-degree-of-freedom system non-linear in both damping and restoring. The approach is modular, allowing an easy update of the methodology on the basis of new research outcomes. Realistic environmental conditions regarding the effects of both wind and waves are taken into account and can be easily changed. The spatial correlation of wind gusts is taken into account by means of an 'aerodynamic admittance' function, whereas the moment due to waves is obtained from the sea slope spectrum using the concept of effective wave slope, leading to a 'hydrodynamic admittance' function. Both static and dynamic aspects of the problems are taken into account. The proposed analytical procedure, based on statistical linearization technique, allows approximate statistical averages of the roll motion, assumed to be Gaussian, to be obtained without necessarily resorting to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the results obtained, an estimation of the capsize probability can be carried out. It seems that the effect of wind gustiness could be considered very small when compared with the effects of waves and mean wind speed when the metacentric height is sufficiently large. Finally, the presented approach moves towards the concept of 'performance-based analysis', recently introduced at the International Maritime Organization as the basis for future developments of intact stability, in a clear and formal way.},

	abstract = {In this paper Ikeda’s method for roll damping prediction is revisited and the applicability of the method to modern volume carriers is considered. For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid {CFD} is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda’s method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.},
