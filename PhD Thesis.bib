The methods are compared using results from a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships and a smaller set of predictions in which the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. Thus, the SI-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave-damping in the SI-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method were proposed based on regression, which gave about the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.},

The parameters of these models are estimated by a statistical learning method. The goodness of the two estimated models for describing a merchant ship's manoeuvrability is first studied using her manoeuvring simulation data. Then, experimental manoeuvring tests to use a USV in open water with wind and drifting effects are used to check the conventional model identification procedures. Finally, some modifications and adjustments are proposed to improve the conventional procedures.

Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem , where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) method. The hybrid method is investigated using roll decay tests with the KVLCC2 test case. This investigation shows that the accuracy of simulated roll motions is significantly improved and also shows good agreement with the corresponding roll decay model tests.},

  abstract = {This thesis is an overview of added resistance in waves, available methods and how a simplified method can be developed. Added resistance in waves is indeed a very complicated problem. The present methods, most of them developed during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following waves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these cases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions. In this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman's method and Boese's method to calculate added resistance is implemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The implementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These evaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using Gerritsma and Beukelman's method. This thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed. This simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended to be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship design. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip calculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency and spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical results from Gerritsma and Beukelman's method. The simplified method has an accuracy of about 25\%, which is about the same amount that usually can be expected of a method to calculate added resistance in waves.},

  abstract = {System identification offers ways to obtain proper models describing a ship's dynamics in real operational conditions but poses significant challenges, such as the multicollinearity and generality of the identified model. This paper proposes a new physics-informed ship manoeuvring model, where a deterministic semi-empirical rudder model has been added, to guide the identification towards a physically correct hydrodynamic model. This is an essential building block to distinguish the hydrodynamic modelling uncertainties from wind, waves, and currents -- in real sea conditions -- which is particularly important for ships with wind-assisted propulsion. In the physics-informed manoeuvring modelling framework, a systematical procedure is developed to establish various force/motion components within the manoeuvring system by inverse dynamics regression. The novel test case wind-powered pure car carrier (wPCC) assesses the physical correctness. First, a reference model, assumed to resemble the physically correct kinetics, is established via parameter identification on virtual captive tests. Then, the model tests are used to build both the physics-informed model and a physics-uninformed mathematical model for comparison. All models predicted the zigzag tests with satisfactory agreement. Thus, they can indeed be considered as being mathematically correct. However, introducing a semi-empirical rudder model seems to have guided the identification towards a more physically correct calm water hydrodynamic model, having lower multicollinearity and better generalization.},

A majority of the publications in this field are based on simulated data. In this paper model test data is used. The identification process can be decomposed into finding a suitable manoeuvring model for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. A parameter estimation is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable manoeuvring model is found using the parameter estimation with cross-validation on a set of competing manoeuvring models. The parameter estimation uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother. Two case study vessels, wPCC and KVLCC2, with very different maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method. Turning circle predictions with the robust manoeuvring models, trained on zigzag model tests, show good agreement with the corresponding model test results for both ships.},

  abstract = {It is common today that operational data is recorded onboard ships within the Internet of Ships (IoS) paradigm. This enables the possibility to build ship digital twins as digital copies of the real ships. Predicting the ship's motions with ship dynamics could be an important sub-component of these ship digital twins. A model for the ship's dynamics can be identified based on observations of the ship's motions. The identified model will have model uncertainty due to imperfections and idealizations made in physical model formulations as well as uncertainty from errors in the measurement data, which can be very pronounced when using full scale operational data. It is easier to develop accurate models with low model uncertainty using data obtained in a controlled laboratory environment where the measurement errors are much lower, especially in calm water conditions. The prediction model should be able to describe scenarios that a ship has never encountered before, which is possible if much of the underlying physics has been identified. Grey-box modelling is a technique which combines operational data with physical principles to achieve this. The objective of this thesis is to develop system identification methods for grey box models with good generalization of the model scale rigid body ship dynamics in calm waters. A model development procedure is proposed to handle the model uncertainty through the selection of candidate models based on a hold-out evaluation procedure. The measurement noise is handled by an iterative preprocessor, which uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother that uses an initially estimated predictor model from semi-empirical formulas. It is demonstrated that the ship's roll motion with high accuracy can be described using a quadratic damping model. For the more complex manoeuvring models, multicollinearity is a large problem where the appropriate complexity needs to be selected with the bias-variance trade-off between underfitting or overfitting the data. Hold-out turning circle tests were predicted with high accuracy for the wPCC and KVLCC2 test case ships with models from the proposed development procedure and parameter estimation method. The proposed methods can produce prediction models with high generalization given that a suitable model structure has been selected from the candidate models and an appropriate split in the hold-out evaluation of the model development process has been applied.},

Despite its short computation time, system-based simulations need many captive model tests to estimate the hydrodynamic and rudder maneuvering coefficients used in the system-based mathematical model and the results have difficulty to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental data. Herein system identification techniques (extended Kalman filtering and constrained least square method using generalized reduced gradient algorithm) are used to predict the maneuvering coefficients from several EFD, systems based and CFD free-running trials. CFD gives not only the ship motions but also the total and component hydrodynamic forces/moments during the free-running simulations, which is helpful for estimating the maneuvering coefficients. Several types of free-running (turning circle, zigzag and large angle zigzag) tests are conducted using EFD and CFD to examine which free-running trial gives the best maneuvering coefficients using system identification. Also several free-running data are combined together for parallel processing. The set of maneuvering coefficients estimated by the constrained least square method using combined CFD free-running trial data show the most generalized results which covers a wide range of maneuvers.},

To that end, the paper identifies the steps in the SDT formulation process and methods used in each step of the process. Furthermore, a four-step iterative procedure for the SDT development is proposed. The applications of the concept are numerous, and some of them are presented in a review analysis in this paper.

  abstract = {Following developments in artificial intelligence and big data technology, the level of intelligence in intelligent vessels has been improved. Intelligent vessels are being developed into unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which have widely interested scholars in the shipping industry due to their safety, high efficiency, and energy-saving qualities. Considering the current development of USVs, the types of USVs and applications domestically and internationally are being investigated. USVs emerged with technological developments and their characteristics show some differences from traditional vessels, which brings some problems and advantages for their application. Certain maritime regulations are not applicable to USVs and must be changed. The key technologies in the current development of USVs are being investigated. While the level of intelligence is improving, the protection of cargo cannot be neglected. An innovative approach to the internal structure of USVs is proposed, where the inner hull can automatically recover its original state in case of outer hull tilting. Finally, we summarize the development status of USVs, which are an inevitable direction of development in the marine field.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing use of virtual prototyping tools in the motorcycle industry, aimed at reducing the development time of new models and speeding up performance optimization, by providing the designer with an in-laboratory virtual test track. Virtual prototyping software are multibody simulation software, which require the availability of models of all the vehicle components. The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modeling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior. In this paper, a grey-box model of a racing motorcycle mono-tube shock absorber is proposed, which consists of a nonlinear parametric model and a black-box, neural-network-based model. The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and validated against experimental test data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the real behavior of the shock absorber with an accuracy that matches or even beats that of other models previously presented in the literature. The interfacing of the proposed model to the ADAMS virtual prototyping environment is also discussed.},

This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.           ,              Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

  abstract = {In this work a combined analytical-numerical approach is proposed to address the problem of the ship roll motion under the combined action of wind and waves. Roll motion is modelled as a one-degree-of-freedom system non-linear in both damping and restoring. The approach is modular, allowing an easy update of the methodology on the basis of new research outcomes. Realistic environmental conditions regarding the effects of both wind and waves are taken into account and can be easily changed. The spatial correlation of wind gusts is taken into account by means of an 'aerodynamic admittance' function, whereas the moment due to waves is obtained from the sea slope spectrum using the concept of effective wave slope, leading to a 'hydrodynamic admittance' function. Both static and dynamic aspects of the problems are taken into account. The proposed analytical procedure, based on statistical linearization technique, allows approximate statistical averages of the roll motion, assumed to be Gaussian, to be obtained without necessarily resorting to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the results obtained, an estimation of the capsize probability can be carried out. It seems that the effect of wind gustiness could be considered very small when compared with the effects of waves and mean wind speed when the metacentric height is sufficiently large. Finally, the presented approach moves towards the concept of 'performance-based analysis', recently introduced at the International Maritime Organization as the basis for future developments of intact stability, in a clear and formal way.},

The computations are performed using CFDShip-Iowa v4, a free surface solver designed for 6DOF motions in free and semi-captive problems. Overset grids and a hierarchy of bodies allow the deflection of the rudders while the ship undergoes 6DOF motions. Two types of maneuvers are simulated: steady turn and zigzag. Simulations of steady turn at 35{$^\circ$} rudder deflection and zigzag 20/20 maneuvers for Fr~=~0.25 and 0.41 using constant RPM propulsion are benchmarked against experimental time histories of yaw, yaw rate and roll, and trajectories, and also compared against available integral variables. Differences between CFD and experiments are mostly within 10~\% for both maneuvers, highly satisfactory given the degree of complexity of these computations. Simulations are performed also with waves, and with propulsion at either constant RPM or torque. 20/20 zigzag maneuvers are simulated at model and full scale for Fr~=~0.41. The full scale case produces a thinner boundary layer profile compared to the model scale with different reaction times and handling needed for maneuvering. Results indicate that URANS computations of maneuvers are feasible, though issues regarding adequate modeling of propellers remain to be solved.},

The sensors consist of a differential air pressure transducer for airspeed measurement, two airdata vanes installed on an airdata probe for angle of attack (AoA) and angle of sideslip (AoS) measurement, and an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) that provides attitude angles, angular rates, and acceleration. The procedure is mainly based on a two pass algorithm called the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, which consists of a forward pass Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a backward recursion smoother. On top of that, this paper proposes the implementation of the Wiener Type Filter prior to the RTS in order to avoid the complicated process noise covariance matrix estimation. Furthermore, an easy to implement airdata measurement noise variance estimation method is introduced. The method estimates the airdata and subsequently the noise variances using the ground speed and ascent rate provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS). It incorporates the idea of data regionality by assuming that some sort of statistical relation exists between nearby data points. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) is being employed to justify the sensor compatibility. The result shows that the presented procedure is easy to implement and it improves the UAV sensor data compatibility significantly.},

In the present study, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method with two propeller modeling methods, Sliding Mesh (SM) and Multiple Reference Frames (MRF), was used to simulate the captive model tests for a KVLCC2 tanker model. The virtual captive model tests, including for resistance, self-propulsion, rudder force, oblique towing, circular motion, oblique towing and steady turning tests with rudder angle, were conducted by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. The computed hydrodynamic forces, hydrodynamic derivatives, and hull-propeller-rudder interaction coefficients were validated against the available captive model test data and the CFD results obtained by a Body Force (BF) method in the literature. Then the standard turning circle and zig-zag maneuvers were simulated by using the MMG (Maneuvering Modeling Group) model with the computed hydrodynamic derivatives and hull-propeller-rudder interaction coefficients, and the results were validated against available free-running model test data. The most satisfactory agreement in terms of the ship hydrodynamic forces and maneuvering parameters and the most accurate rudder normal force were obtained by the SM method rather than by the MRF or the BF methods, while the lateral forces and yaw moments obtained by the SM and the MRF methods were all in good agreement with the model test data.},

As a necessary technology of MASS, ship motion prediction still has some problems, such as low efficiency, poor real-time performance, and easy to be affected by sea conditions. Aiming at the above problems, based on the mathematical model of ship maneuvering motion, this paper uses the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) identification algorithm, to establish an offline black-box identification model of MASS motion considering rudder angle and propeller revolution rates, and effectively predicts the motion of ships. On this basis, a sliding window is designed, and an error-based online modeling method of ship motion is proposed to realize adaptive prediction of MASS motion under the effect of ocean waves. A large MASS was selected for modeling and simulation experiments. The results show that compared with the traditional LS-SVM modeling algorithm, the model built by this method has a strong adaptive ability and can maintain high accuracy for a long time, meeting the needs of real-time prediction of MASS motion in practical applications.},

Virtual captive model tests are performed by using a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method to acquire hydrodynamic derivatives, after a convergence study to check the numerical accuracy. The turning and zigzag maneuvers are simulated by solving the maneuvering motion model and the predicted results agree well with the experimental data. Moreover, free running model tests are carried out for three lateral separations and the influence of the lateral separations on maneuvering performance is investigated. The research results of this paper will be helpful for the maneuvering prediction of the small waterplane area twin hull ship.},

The identification and validation with the simulation data are carried out using a 25{$^\circ$} turning test and a 20{$^\circ-$}20{$^\circ$} zigzag manoeuvring test. For the free-running test data, two zigzag manoeuvres are used: 30{$^\circ-$}30{$^\circ$} zigzag for identification and 20{$^\circ-$}20{$^\circ$} zigzag for validation. A nonlinear manoeuvring model is proposed based on the standard Euler equations, and the hydrodynamic coefficients are computed using empirical equations. To obtain robust results, the truncated singular value decomposition is employed to diminish the multicollinearity and the parameter uncertainties due to noise. The validation is carried out by comparing the result of the measured values with the predictions obtained using the manoeuvring models. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the simulation data is performed to understand the influence of the parameters in the manoeuvres.},

In this study, a Bayesian optimization-based decision support system, which utilizes ship performance models built by machine learning methods, is proposed to help determine the operational set-points of two engines for double-ended ferries. By optimizing the ferries' power allocation between the stern and bow engines, the Decision Support System (DSS) will simultaneously attempt to keep the ETA of the ferry fixed under a set of operational constraints using the Bayesian optimization. Its objective is to minimize fuel consumption along individual trips. Based on simulation environment, the DSS can reduce at maximum 40 \% fuel consumption with no significant change of the ETA. Final full-scale experiments of a double-ended ferry demonstrated an average of 15 \%, where at least half of this saving was achieved by the optimized power allocation between bow and stern engines.},

  abstract = {The need for pollution reduction of commercial shipping might make the reintroduction of sail propulsion desirable. A ship under sail will travel with a drift angle due to the side forces created by the sail. This leads to non-axial inflow on the propeller, named oblique flow. The effect of oblique inflow on the propeller's performance has previously been researched for large angles up to 30. This paper outlines the effect for angles between 0 and 10, which was thus far unknown. A numerical model, that proved its applicability for large angles, was used. Results showed an increase for both dimensionless thrust and torque, KT \& KQ, which led to an increase of the propeller's performance. Also open water propeller tests, performed at the TU Delft, were conducted. Tests showed a more significant increase for all values than the model did. The model makes assumptions that led to an underestimation. Open water tests, conducted at a too low Reynolds number, resulted in an overestimation. Neither method is sufficient for estimation of the propeller's performance in oblique flow. We conclude that the truth lies somewhere in between both outcomes. For further analysis more open water tests need to be conducted at a higher Reynolds number to eliminate scale errors.},

Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial RANS solver based on a finite volume method (FVM) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using VOF (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with URANS approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz's non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature. In addition, viscous effects have been investigated using Eulerian approach for several static drift cases.},

Simulations were performed using codes that solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the nonlinear rigid body equations of motion. Different time scales existing between ship motions and fluid flow as well as diverging spatial discretizations of hull and propulsor in conjunction with the propulsor's rotation increased the required computational efforts, rendering the model unsuitable for comprehensive parametric investigations. To overcome these difficulties, a mixture between mesh morphing for small-scale motions and global displacement of the mesh for large-scale motions was developed. Previous investigations mostly replicated captive model tests or resolved the viscous flow more precisely to explore various dedicated effects. RANS simulations offer valuable insight into scale effects involved in maneuvering prediction as they allow the study of both ship and model scale flows. This paper explores the reliability of both direct maneuvering simulation (using a combination of a freely moving ship including the rotating propulsor) and simulations based upon the virtual replication of captive model tests (using Taylor-series expansions to model the external hydrodynamic forces). The influence of engine-propulsor interaction in maneuvering motion behavior and scale effects is discussed. Predictions are compared to model tests and sea trials.},

  abstract = {Inverse dynamics is a technique in which measured kinematics and, possibly, external forces are used to calculate net joint torques in a rigid body linked segment model. However, kinematics and forces are usually not consistent due to incorrect modelling assumptions and measurement errors. This is commonly resolved by introducing `residual forces and torques' which compensate for this problem, but do not exist in reality. In this study a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed that finds the kinematics that are mechanically consistent with measured external forces and mimic the measured kinematics as closely as possible. The algorithm was tested on datasets containing planar kinematics and ground reaction forces obtained during human walking at three velocities (0.8 m/s, 1.25 and 1.8 m/s). Before optimization, the residual force and torque were calculated for a typical example. Both showed substantial values, indicating the necessity of developing a mechanically consistent algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm converged to a solution in which the residual forces and torques were zero, without changing the ground reaction forces and with only minor changes to the measured kinematics. When using a rigid body approach, our algorithm ensures a consistent description of forces and kinematics, thereby improving the validity of calculated net joint torque and power values.},

The methodology consists of simulating various planar motion mechanism (PMM) tests simultaneously in a single numerical analysis. As a technical method, a stationary numerical domain has been used. Therefore, non-inertial forms of the fluid flow governing equations have been solved for simulating sinusoidal tests in a stationary numerical domain. Consequently, the quality of the grids has been preserved during the analyses. With considering of the well-known underwater geometry of DARPA-SUBOFF, validation of the numerical simulation results has been done with the computing of the pure sway and the pure yaw tests. The PMM maneuvers were induced to the numerical analyses by using a user-defined function augmented to the solver. The current results are in good agreement with the experimental ones reported in the literature. Based on the superposition rule which can be used for combining dynamic tests, a synthetic test has been designed consisted of the pure sway and the pure yaw tests. It has been developed to form more advanced synthetic tests consisted of the various PMM tests as well. The test has the capability to use for deriving non-linear HCs as well as the liner ones. The efficiency of the proposed method has been compared with the other methods, which shows it is comparable to the other approaches.},

  abstract = {Small USVs are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most USV systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two GNSS antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small USV systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an RTK GNSS receiver is used. The drawback of the RTK solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter (EKF) aided by GNSS latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground (COG), speed over ground (SOG), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a USV. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four EKF covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different GNSS receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the EKF is that the autopilot does not need to use the COG and SOG measurements from the GNSS receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to the EKF to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state EKF is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial USV systems.},

The basis for the control system is a nonlinear maneuvering model that describes the coupled motions in surge, sway and yaw. In order to follow a predefined path, the ship must be equipped with minimum two actuators that produce a surge force and a yaw moment. Moreover, only two controls are needed to control an under actuated ship in three Degrees Of Freedom (DOF). Path following is achieved by a geometric assignment based on a LOS projection algorithm for minimization of the cross-track error to the path. The LOS algorithm computes heading angle commands to the autopilot system.The desired speed along the path is controlled independently of the heading autopilot. The path-following controller is model based and a nonlinear hydrodynamic model is used to derive the motion control system. A ship case study using a scale model illustrates the path-following capabilities.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a simple but robust approach for the identification of the main interaction effect of hull and propeller on the rudder inflow in a conventional manoeuvring simulator. The manoeuvring simulator adopts a modular/MMG based approach in which the hull, the rudders and the propellers are described by separate mathematical models which take into account the interaction phenomena. The propeller--rudder interaction factor is examined by means of a numerical model developed in OpenFOAM for the prediction of the performance of a rudder in behind propeller condition. Differently the hull--rudder interaction factor is numerically obtained by means of two different approaches. The proposed kinematic method shows the minimum additional computational cost without loss of accuracy. It is based on the analysis of rudder inflow fields (in a PIV fashioned), therefore It can be carried out in a post-processing phase of CFD simulations adopted to extract the hydrodynamic coefficients. This study validates the method by comparing it with the classical approach also used in the experimental campaign, based on the analysis of rudder forces from virtual captive tests. The approaches demonstrate to improve the overall accuracy of the main manoeuvring parameters with respect to the ones obtained by means of a calibrated semi-empirical model.},

  abstract = {Ship manoeuvrability has been generally predicted based on 3-DOF mathematical model. However, medium-high speed ships such as containerships and passenger ferries make sometimes a large roll motion by the steering, which more or less affects on the ship manoeuvrability. Although a lot of researches have been done about the effect of roll motion, the mathematical models of hydrodynamic forces have been proposed individually putting the additional terms of roll angle into the conventional 3-DOF mathematical model. This makes the difficulty in the prediction of manoeuvrability. In this paper, the captive model tests have been performed with a container ship and a passenger ferry. In order to grasp the characteristics of the effect of roll angle on the conventional 3-DOF mathematical model, CMT(Circular Motion Test) have been carried out with setting a constant roll angles. And then, the effects of roll angle on the hydrodynamic derivatives have been extracted. From this analysis, the suitable 4-DOF mathematical model has been introduced by means of eliminating the less contributing terms of the roll effect. For the validation of the proposed mathematical model, free running model tests were carried out with several GM and ship's speed since the roll angle during a manoeuvring is affected by them. After comparing simulated results by the proposed 4-DOF mathematical model and the results of free running model test, it is found that the effect of GM and ship's speed on turning trajectories or the overshoot of Z-test can be well predicted by the proposed 4-DOF mathematical model.},

  abstract = {Direct design of a robot's rendered dynamics, such as in impedance control, is now a well-established control mode in uncertain environments. When the physical interaction port variables are not measured directly, dynamic and kinematic models are required to relate the measured variables to the interaction port variables. A typical example is serial manipulators with joint torque sensors, where the interaction occurs at the end-effector. As interactive robots perform increasingly complex tasks, they will be intermittently coupled with additional dynamic elements such as tools, grippers, or workpieces, some of which should be compensated and brought to the robot side of the interaction port, making the inverse dynamics multimodal. Furthermore, there may also be unavoidable and unmeasured external input when the desired system cannot be totally isolated. Towards semi-autonomous robots, capable of handling such applications, a multimodal Gaussian process regression approach to manipulator dynamic modelling is developed. A sampling-based approach clusters different dynamic modes from unlabelled data, also allowing the seperation of perturbed data with significant, irregular external input. The passivity of the overall approach is shown analytically, and experiments examine the performance and safety of this approach on a test actuator.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear responses of ship rolling motion characterized by a roll damping moment are of great interest to naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear damping moment are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll damping moment of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in damping moment to be estimated, including its reliability analysis.},

Hence, building a full scale prototype to test, verify, and demonstrate effectiveness of new innovative solutions, is not an option in maritime sector. Model testing and simulation of separate modules have been practiced in many applications successfully, however, capturing the complete interaction of different modules in a maritime system is not straight forward. To best of our knowledge, the modeling and simulation of a maritime system to the extent where the complete system, including the mutual interactions, is not accomplished yet. A maritime system incorporates a wide variety of components from different engineering fields and in order to develop a simulation framework for such a complex system, an interdisciplinary effort is needed from different branches of science including but not limited to hydrodynamics, machinery and power systems, structural engineering, navigation and control. This paper aims to introduce a joint effort from different research institutes, universities, and industrial partners to shed a light on the different issues in virtual prototyping in maritime systems and operations. It summarizes some of the available frameworks for virtual prototyping, and ends with a numerical simulation of a generic hull model coupled with propellers, propeller actuators, DP controller, thrust loss calculations, wind, waves and current, performed with the current implementation of our Virtual Prototyping Framework (VPF).},

The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.},

  abstract = {The so-called ``Fourth Industrial revolution'', also termed as ``Industry 4.0'' in the wider literature, is associated with several cutting-edge technologies. Indicative examples in this category are advanced applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT), which are already influencing the maritime industry. It is indicative of the fact that there are several construction projects of autonomous ships, such as the Yara Birkeland and the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), which are heavily reliant on technologies associated with the Industry 4.0 concept. The maritime transport industry is already transitioning into a new operations paradigm, often termed as ``shipping in the era of digitalization''. Shipping companies promote digitalization as the future of the maritime industry and their efforts to set up strategies are already in progress. Examining those visions and strategies in relation to digitalization would be beneficial to better understand the way towards which the maritime industry is heading. This paper is aiming to identify the characteristics of that pool of future plans via a qualitative review and with a particular focus on major maritime commercial actors, based on shipping companies' relevant action plans that were gathered online. A conclusion standing out is that major shipping companies have embraced digitalization to increase cost-efficiency, raise competitiveness and meet the needs of their customers.},

The mathematical model, which describes the ship maneuvering motion, is developed employing the coupled equations of surge, sway, yaw, roll and propeller revolution. Computations are made for various kinds and types of the merchant ships and for wide range of the maneuvering characteristics. The computed results show satisfactory agreements with the full-scale trial results. In addition, as an application study, the effect of the loading condition on the ship maneuverability is investigated through the simulation calculations. The conclusion is that the calculation method of the present study is very useful and powerful for the predictions of the ship maneuverability at the time, such as the initial design stage etc., when the principal particulars of ship hull, propeller and rudder are known.},

  author = {Irannezhad, Mohsen},
  year = {2024},
  urldate = {2024-08-12},
  abstract = {In order to design fuel-efficient ships and install compatible propulsion systems, ship and propeller designers need to know the potential effects of the interactions between different ship components, e.g., hull, propeller, appendages and machinery, on the ship performance at sea. Neglecting the interaction effects may result in unbalanced powering which adversely affects the energy/fuel consumption, hence increasing ships operational cost and environmental impact. Developing accurate and reliable engineering methods that can predict the ships required power considering the interaction effects, can be an important contribution to achieve the aforementioned needs of the shipping industry. {$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$}Traditionally, power prediction has been carried out for ships operating in calm water rather than more realistic environmental conditions. However, waves can play a crucial role on the ship performance at sea. The interactions between waves, hull and the propulsion system of a ship may significantly affect the ship motions, resistance, wake, speed and propeller/engine load in comparison to calm water operational conditions. Nonetheless, it is practically impossible to take all of the entailed interactions between different ship components into consideration within the process of power prediction in all possible operational and environmental conditions, hence a series of assumptions and simplifications are often introduced. {$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$}In this thesis, as a step towards the ship power prediction in more realistic environmental conditions, the propeller-hull interaction effects in a range of selective operational conditions in calm water and regular head waves are considered in model-scale. The main objective is to perform numerical investigations of the ship performance in these conditions, aiming at understanding the involved flow physics in the propeller-hull interaction effects on the ship behavior and its propulsion characteristics. The investigations in both calm water and regular head waves are carried out in three distinctive steps: only the bare hull consideration, only the propeller consideration known as propeller open water (POW) and finally, for the self-propelled hull. The bare hull investigations incorporate employing two computational methods: a Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow (FNPF) panel method and a state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. However, for the POW and self-propulsion studies only the RANS approach is employed. A formal verification and validation (V\&amp;V) procedure is applied to understand and control the numerical and modeling errors in the RANS computations. {$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$}Overall, the results of the employed numerical methods were in good agreement with the experimental data. The analysis of the results provided valuable insight into the ship and propeller hydrodynamic performance in terms of the ship motions, resistance, wake, propeller characteristics and the correlations between them. The ship hydrodynamics analyses from this thesis can shed more light onto the propeller-hull interaction effects in waves and help the ship/propeller designers optimize their designs for more realistic conditions than only calm water.},

The performance of PLS regression is also compared with that of the conventional least squares (LS) regression using the same dataset. Simulation results show the satisfactory identification and generalization performances of PLS regression and its superiority in comparison with the LS method, which demonstrates its capability in processing measurement data with high dimensionality and heavy multicollinearity, especially in processing data with small sample size.},

Forecasts of the vessels' trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the mathematical manoeuvring model, which is an essential component of their hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship KCS as an object of study, this paper adopts a 4-DOF modular-type manoeuvring (MMG) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential flow solver WASIM, which is based on Rankine panel method. The computed vessel trajectories and motions are compared with available literature results and show good correlation.},

RDE had emerged earlier in the study of the second variations in the calculus of variations, but its use in general linear systems, where the optimal trajectory needs to be generated by a control input, was new. The analysis throughout the paper concentrates on timevarying systems, and uses the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to arrive at RDE and to deduce optimality of the LQ control gain. We now know, however, that an alternative way to prove optimality in least squares is by showing how RDE allows one to "complete the square" (see, e.g., [5], [18]).},

  abstract = {Accurate calculation of the roll damping moment at resonance condition is essential for roll motion prediction. Because at the resonance condition, the moment of inertia counteracts restoring moment and only the damping moment resists increase in the roll angle. There are various methods to calculate the roll damping moment which are based on potential flow theory. These methods have limitations to taking into account the viscous effects in estimating the roll motion, while, CFD as a numerical method is capable of considering the viscous effects. In this study, a CFD method based on a harmonic excited roll motion (HERM) technique is used to compute the roll motion and the roll damping moment of a containership's model in different conditions. The influence of excitation frequency, forward speed and degrees of freedom at beam-sea and oblique-sea realizations are considered in estimating the roll damping coefficients. The results are validated against model tests, where a good agreement is found.},

  abstract = {The prediction of the behavior of ships in a seaway has been an important topic in ship design since the beginning of modern naval architecture. In recent years, computer simulations using numerical methods based on mathematical models of the ship hydrodynamics problem has become a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in this field. A large variety of methods with different levels of sophistication and accuracy already exist today, all being suitable for specific problems. However, with the current trend of larger, more advanced and optimized designs and focus turning more and more towards safety and energy efficiency, nonlinear phenomena are becoming more important and many of the traditional methods have problems in producing accurate results for certain cases due to assumptions and neglected physical effects in the underlying mathematical model. The overall objective of this project is the development and implementation of a fully nonlinear unsteady three-dimensional boundary element method for ship motion analysis, applicable to problems with a high degree of nonlinearities while still being suitable for practical use. The method is capable of predicting wave induced loads and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i.e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level and self interaction between the forward speed flow field as well as radiated and diffracted waves. This thesis presents the mathematical model, the numerical method and numerical results obtained from the application of the method to a number of relevant test cases. Results from the application of the method are provided, including the propagation of a regular long-crested wave, the wave resistance problem in calm water and the radiation and diffraction problem in regular and irregular head sea. The results are limited to heave and pitch motions and are compared with analytical or experimental data, numerical results from other methods or, in some cases, both. The method has proved to be able to capture strong nonlinear effects in heave and pitch motions and its feasibility as a qualified analysis tool for such cases has been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The need to reduce green-house gas emissions from shipping has reborn the interest in wind propulsion for commercial cargo vessels. This places new requirements on the tools used in ship design, as well as the methods usually applied in sailing yacht design. A range of design tools are used by designers at various stages in the design of wind-assisted ships and for different purposes. One important tool is the steady-state velocity prediction program (VPP) which is typically used to predict the speed of the vessel when sailing in a range of wind directions and wind speeds. Steady-state VPPs can be very efficient and fast and may be used to rapidly assess a large number of design alternatives. However, steady-state VPPs are not able to consider dynamic effects such as unsteady wave forces on the hull which may require the rudder to be active to control the heading and course of the vessel. This, in turn, leads to different mean forces than those predicted by a static VPP and therefore the sailing performance may be reduced compared to the predictions of a static VPP. Another effect of the ship's motions in a seaway is that the angles of attack of the sails fluctuate, which can lead to different optimum sheeting angles and possibly a loss of performance. This study uses an unsteady 3D fully nonlinear potential flow hydrodynamic model coupled with an efficient lifting-line aerodynamic model to investigate the differences in sailing performance of a vessel sailing in steady conditions to the performance when sailing in a seaway and gusty wind based on a spatio-temporal wind model. The analysis shows clearly that the unsteady wind model affects the predicted performance. This is especially the case when sailing close-hauled and on a beam reach, where large changes in the local sail angles of attack can be observed.},

Forced roll and free decay experiments were carried out at MARINTEK in a joint project between VARD, DNV GL and MARINTEK during Nov. 2012. The 1:25 ship model was tested both with and without bilge keels. 19 forced roll periods were tested at 4 roll angles (2, 4, 6 and 10deg). Free decay tests were performed for initial roll angles 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15deg. Damping was extracted and compared with numerical simulations from a potential flow strip theory program (VERES) and a commercial CFD tool (StarCCM+). Both qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experimentally and numerically obtained damping parameters was documented. Discrepancies were identified and discussed. The three different methods of investigation gave together a basis for discussing the effect of bilge keels. From the present study, it is recommended that both experimental and numerical work in combination, for both forced roll and free decay tests, should be performed to assess the damping efficiency of bilge keels.

First, a general data pre-processing framework is presented. The different machine learning based models are trained by both ship operational parameters and encountered metocean conditions. Based on the full-scale measurement data collected at two types of worldwide sailing ships, the pros and cons of different machine learning algorithms for the ship's speed--power performance modeling are compared. Finally, the best performed XGboost model is chosen to analyze the sensitivity due to the amount of available ship data, assumed time period for each stationary waypoint (data sample) used for the model training, and their impact on online performance prediction.},

  abstract = {Operational optimization of ocean vessels, both off-line and in real-time, is becoming increasingly important due to rising fuel cost and added environmental constraints. Accurate and efficient simulation models are needed to achieve maximum energy efficiency. In this paper a grey-box modeling approach for the simulation of ocean vessels is presented. The modeling approach combines conventional analysis models based on physical principles (a white-box model) with a feed forward neural-network (a black-box model). Two different ways of combining these models are presented, in series and in parallel. The results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey-box modeling approach, both serial and parallel approaches, can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white-box model. However, a prediction of the vessel speed is only improved slightly. Furthermore, the results give an indication of the potential advantages of grey-box models, which is extrapolation beyond a given training data set and the incorporation of physical phenomena which are not modeled in the white-box models. Finally, included is a discussion on how to enhance the predictability of the grey-box models as well as updating the neural-network in real-time.},

A Mathematical Model Group (MMG) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test (OTT) and dynamic Circular Motion Test (CMT) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the MMG model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. The MMG hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom MMG model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35{$^\circ$}turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard KRISO Container Ship (KCS). These tests show that the motion prediction and free-running maneuvering results can agree with the standard experimental data well.},

This approach combines hydrodynamic terms from classical models to form a priori dictionary and utilizes the sequential thresholded least-squares (STLS) algorithm and Bayesian optimization to identify model counterparts and adaptively optimize the hyperparameters. The proposed method was validated using KVLCC2 ship experimental data, NPS-AUV simulation data and Star Ocean II AUV experimental data, and it can achieve both high accuracy and good interpretability with low complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 100 times faster than the Gaussian process and achieves the same level of accuracy.},

The present study of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations aims to offer a numerical tool for maneuvering prediction with high accuracy. The virtual captive model tests for a model scale KCS container ship are conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computation to obtain the full set of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives in the 3rd-order Abkowitz model. The numerical uncertainty analysis is carried out for the pure sway and yaw-drift tests to verify the numerical accuracy. It is concluded that the lower order Fourier coefficients are preferred in the computation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. Moreover, part of the computed hydrodynamic forces and moments are compared with the available captive model test data, and good agreement is obtained. By substituting the computed hydrodynamic derivatives into the mathematical model, the standard turning and zigzag maneuvers are predicted. By comparing the predicted maneuvering results with the available experimental data and the prediction results by others, it is demonstrated that acceptable prediction accuracy can be achieved with the present method, which shows the effectiveness of the present method in predicting ship maneuverability. {\copyright} 2018 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {This study reveals the significance of hydrodynamic derivatives derived at the different Froud number (Fr) in accurately predicting of a vessel's turning-circle maneuvers through solving the maneuvering modeling group (MMG) model. The computed turning-circle diameter showed a good agreement with the model test results, with less than 4\% difference observed when using the hydrodynamic derivatives derived at Fr~=~0.201. However, at Fr~=~0.26, a significant difference was observed, which could be attributed to the use of lower values of maximum sway amplitude ymax and maximum yaw rate rmax{$\prime$}. The hydrodynamic characteristics of a maneuvering vessel may not be fully reflected, with the high displacement of the straight surging motion dominating the results. In this study, a set of virtual planar motion mechanism (PMM) captive tests is numerically conducted on a bare container ship hull model using an open-source code OpenFOAM.

The methods are based on a comparison between the measured outputs and the outputs of a candidate model. Depending on the set of models that is used, such methods are known under a variety of names, like output-error methods, equation-error methods, maximum-likelihood methods, etc. General results are proved concerning the models that are selected asymptotically as the number of observed data tends to infinity. For these results it is not assumed that the true system necessarily can be exactly represented within the chosen set of models. In the particular case when the model set contains the system, general consistency results are obtained and commented upon. Rather than to seek an exact description of the system, it is usually more realistic to be content with a suitable approximation of the true system with reasonable complexity properties. Here, the consequences of such a viewpoint are discussed.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

Studies on a high-speed catamaran, there was a great number of theoretical, numerical studies, and experimental investigation, most of them have focused on the resistance performance. In addition, a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method has become a possible tool to predict hydrodynamics. This study focuses on predicting hydrodynamic maneuvering characteristics of high-speed catamaran by utilizing RANS (Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes) solver. The Delft 372 catamaran model was selected as the target hull to analyze hydrodynamic characteristics. Due to the high-speed condition and changeable attitude, the motion of the catamaran was complex. The comparisons of the obtained CFD results including the free surface effects in resistance performance with experimental data were shown a relatively good agreement and it could demonstrate that the presented method could be used for predicting hydrodynamic coefficients of high-speed catamaran. Then virtual captive model tests were performed to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients. The lower-order Fourier coefficients were applied to get the hydrodynamic coefficients in dynamic motion. The linear fitting to Fourier coefficients was observed very well using least square method in the harmonic motion.},

  abstract = {Virtual prototypes (VPs) are digital models that mock-up existing or conceptual systems' behaviour. In offshore operations, VPs find usages in design, proof of concept for new equipment or method, control system testing, procedure planning, and expert crew training. Moreover, VP can be used in full mission simulators with crews of maritime and offshore engineers, in which case they integrate with control systems such as handles and dynamic positioning systems. Putting the human in the loop sets high requirements for the fidelity of the visual 3D-models and the mathematical models' validity. VPs are thus time-consuming to create and difficult to validate, even based on an existing offshore system. This paper presents an innovative framework for rapid virtual prototyping of ships for hardware and human in the loop simulations and validates the results with data gathered in a sea trial performed on a research vessel, with satisfying results for position keeping.

  abstract = {Assessing the manoeuvring performances of a ship at a design stage is becoming more important, especially when trying to improve shipping efficiency to reduce fuel consumption. When designing a hull with appendages, it is necessary to balance hydrodynamic efficiency with manoeuvrability. Therefore, the possibility of simulating a captive test at a design stage will increase the chances of understanding the behaviour of a ship from an early stage in the design process. The current research is based on the evaluation of hydrodynamic efficiency of a hull and appendages in a pure resistance, self-propulsion and in a wind-assisted mode. The forces and moments acting on the hull and appendages are then analysed and used as inputs for a Virtual Captive Test (VCT) [1]. In order to correctly perform a VCT and further analyse the performances of a ship with a Velocity Prediction Programme (VPP), particular care has been put in correctly capturing the manoeuvrability coefficients. Those are derived with polynomial fittings once the forces and moments acting on the ship are extracted from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Many CFD simulations were performed to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull and appendages in a range of flow directions, rudder angles and rotating flow. Those simulations encompass the whole range of datapoints needed to describe a wind-assisted ship during manoeuvring. Taking into consideration both hydrodynamic characteristics and manoeuvrability effects at an early design stage can reduce model tests costs and will allow to inspect a larger number of hull-appendages scenarios when analysing the final VPP results.},

However, to take advantage of these benefits in model predictive control (MPC) for legged robots, it is crucial to handle efficiently its large number of equality constraints. To accomplish this, we first (i) propose a novel approach to handle equality constraints based on nullspace parametrization. Our approach balances optimality, and both dynamics and equality-constraint feasibility appropriately, which increases the basin of attraction to high-quality local minima. To do so, we (ii) modify our feasibility-driven search by incorporating a merit function. Furthermore, we introduce (iii) a condensed formulation of inverse dynamics that considers arbitrary actuator models. We also propose (iv) a novel MPC based on inverse dynamics within a perceptive locomotion framework. Finally, we present (v) a theoretical comparison of optimal control with forward and inverse dynamics and evaluate both numerically. Our approach enables the first application of inverse-dynamics MPC on hardware, resulting in state-of-the-art dynamic climbing on the ANYmal robot. We benchmark it over a wide range of robotics problems and generate agile and complex maneuvers. We show the computational reduction of our nullspace resolution and condensed formulation (up to 47.3\%). We provide evidence of the benefits of our approach by solving coarse optimization problems with a high convergence rate (up to 10 Hz of discretization). Our algorithm is publicly available inside CROCODDYL.},

  abstract = {Modeling is the most important component in predictive controller design. It should predict outputs precisely and fast. Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible. In a good ship model the standard deviation of a particular coefficient should not exceed 10\% of its value. Fitting the validation data to 80\% for short-term prediction and 65\% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to fit the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identification procedure is proposed. In the first step a predictive linear model is identified conventionally, and then coefficients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefficient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100\% of their values to approximately 5\% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71\% and 54\% to 89\% and 76\%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufficiently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.},

  abstract = {Digital Twins have much attention in the shipping industry, attempting to support all phases of a vessel's life cycle. With several tools appearing in Digital Twin software suites, high-quality manoeuvring and performance prediction remain cornerstones. Propulsion efficiency is in focus while in service. Simulator-based training is in focus to ensure safety of manoeuvring in confined waters and harbours. Prediction of ships' velocity and turn rate are essential for correct look and feel during training, but phenomena like dynamic inflow to propellers, bank and shallow water effects limit simulators' accuracy, and master mariners often comment that simulations could be in better agreement with actual behaviours of their vessel. This paper focuses on digital twin enhancements to better match reality. Using data logged during in-service operation, we first consider a system identification perspective, employing a first-principles model structure. Showing that a complete first-principles model is not identifiable under the excitation met in service, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to predict deviations between measured velocities and the model output. The outcome is a hybrid of a first-principles model with a machine learning generic approximator add-on. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy of both in-harbour manoeuvring and shallow water passage conditions.},

  abstract = {This study aims to investigate the nonlinear added mass moment of inertia and damping moment characteristics of large-amplitude ship roll motion based on transient motion data through the nonparametric system identification method. An inverse problem was formulated to solve the first-kind Volterra-type integral equation using sets of motion signal data. However, this numerical approach leads to solution instability due to noisy data. Regularization is a technique that can overcome the lack of stability; hence, Landweber's regularization method was employed in this study. The L-curve criterion was used to select regularization parameters (number of iterations) that correspond to the accuracy of the inverse solution. The solution of this method is a discrete moment, which is the summation of nonlinear restoring, nonlinear damping, and nonlinear mass moment of inertia. A zero-crossing detection technique is used in the nonparametric system identification method on a pair of measured data of the angular velocity and angular acceleration of a ship, and the detections are matched with the inverse solution at the same discrete times. The procedure was demonstrated through a numerical model of a full nonlinear free-roll motion system in still water to examine and prove its accuracy. Results show that the method effectively and efficiently identified the functional form of the nonlinear added moment of inertia and damping moment.},

The three coupled maneuvering equations in this model for large tankers contain linear and nonlinear terms and instead of attempting to determine the parameters (i.e.~hydrodynamic derivatives) associated with nonlinear terms, all nonlinear terms are clubbed together to form one unknown time function per equation which are sought to be represented by the neural network coefficients. The time series used in training the network are obtained from simulated data of zigzag maneuvers and the proposed method has been applied to these data. The neural network scheme adopted in this work has one middle or hidden layer of neurons and it employs the Levenberg--Marquardt algorithm. Using the best choices for the number of hidden layer neurons, length of training data, convergence tolerance etc., the performance of the proposed neural network model has been investigated and conclusions drawn.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic coefficients (HDCs) in the equations of motion for trajectory simulation of any underwater vehicle are inherent characteristics of the body geometry. At the concept design stage of underwater vehicles, there is a requirement for affordable and efficient use of general-purpose CFD tools to get a first estimate of the HDCs, with greater accuracy than empirical methods, but at lesser cost and time than model testing. This paper reports the prediction of values of straight-line and rotary HDCs for a submerged axisymmetric body of revolution using a general-purpose RANSE solver and with modest, readily available computational facilities. Various alternatives for grid generation and grid size have been compared and a solution strategy evolved to optimize requirements of accuracy, time and computational resources. Linear and nonlinear HDCs for straight-line and rotary motions were obtained by curve-fitting of the forces and moments plotted against angle of attack and angular velocity. To compute rotary HDCs, an approach was evolved to define a circular domain and effectively simulate the motion of a model in Rotating Arm captive model tests. Results were compared with experimental results from Planar Motion Mechanism tests of the same body. The trends in variation of forces and moments are captured well by computations. Accuracy obtained for yaw moment HDCs is comparable to the uncertainty levels from model tests. It is shown that CFD techniques offer flexibility for computing nonlinear coefficients as well, by simulating combinations of linear and angular velocities.},

However, experimental data on roll damping of inland vessels are scarce and unreliable. Thus the applicability of classic Ikeda's method and its simplified version on typical European inland vessels is investigated, with specific focus on eddy making component. It is found that the simplified Ikeda's method, in comparison to the classic method, may considerably underestimate the eddy making component of damping of full hull forms, or even return negative values, although the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability. Hence, the paper explores possibilities of adjusting the simplified Ikeda's method in order to improve the observed shortcoming, as well as to extend its application to stability analysis of inland ships.},

Examples considered include the forecasting of the seastate elevations and vessel responses using their past time records as ``explanatory variables'' or ``features'' and the development of a nonlinear model for the roll restoring, added moment of inertia and viscous damping using the vessel response kinematics from free decay tests as ``features''. A key innovation of AI-SVM kernel algorithms is that the nonlinear dependence of the dependent variable on the ``features'' is embedded into the SVM kernel and its selection plays a key role in the performance of the algorithms. The kernel selection is discussed and its relation to the physics of the marine hydrodynamic flows considered in the present paper is addressed.},

Standard manoeuvring tests are simulated to evaluate the ship's manoeuvring qualities. This paper deals with the estimation of linear, nonlinear and roll-coupled hydrodynamic derivatives of a container ship by numerically simulating static and dynamic tests at different roll angles using a RANSE solver. The mathematical model suitable for the nonlinear roll-coupled steering model for high-speed container ships is considered here. In order to include the effect of roll on the ship, the roll-dependent derivatives are estimated by using static and dynamic tests numerically performed at discrete heel angles. Standard definitive manoeuvres such as turning circle and zig-zag tests are numerically simulated by solving the equations of motion and the results are verified with those obtained by using experimental values.},

  abstract = {Ship maneuvering models are the keys to the research of ship maneuverability, design of ship motion control system and development of ship handling simulators. For various frames of ship maneuvering models, determining the parameters of the models is always a tedious task. System identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models by the system's input data and output data. In this paper, based on the analysis of ship hydrodynamics, a nonlinear model frame of ship maneuvering is established. System identification theory is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. An algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter theory is proposed to calculate the parameters. In order to gain the system's input and output data, which is necessary for the parameters identification experiment, turning circle tests and Zig-zag tests are performed on shiphandling simulator and the initial data is collected. Based on the Fixed Interval Kalman Smoothing algorithm, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed to process the raw data of the tests. With this algorithm, the errors introduced during the measurement process are eliminated. Parameters identification experiments are designed to estimate the model parameters, and the ship maneuvering model parameters estimation algorithm is extended to modify the parameters being estimated. Then the model parameters and the ship maneuvering model are determined. Simulation validation was carried out to simulate the ship maneuverability. Comparisons have been made to the simulated data and measured data. The results show that the ship maneuvering model determined by our approach can seasonably reflect the actual motion of ship, and the parameter estimation procedure and algorithms are effective.},

For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid CFD is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda's method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.},

The purpose of the workshop was to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship maneuvering simulation methods including systems- and CFD-based methods through systematic quantitative comparisons and validation against EFD data for tanker (KVLCC), container ship (KCS), and surface combatant (5415) hull form test cases. For the KVLCC test case, two stern shape variants named KVLCC1 and KVLCC2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and CFD for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided PMM and CMT data, and two used CFD instead. CFD-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with PMM/CMT model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as PMM- and CMT-based methods, CFD based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different CFD-based methods such as RANS, URANS, and DES. This paper gives an overview of hulls, model tests, test cases, submissions, comparison results as well as the most important observations and conclusions.},

  abstract = {The efficient algorithm for high-order inverse dynamics of serial robots is an essential need in design and model-based control of robots equipped with serial elastic joints. Although several efficient algorithms have been proposed, the introduction of new frameworks can lead to new understanding and further improvements. Based on the projective geometric algebra (PGA) for Euclidean geometry, this paper provides a recursive algorithm that is computationally efficient, intuitive, uniform, and coordinate invariant. In the PGA-based method, calculations of the exponential map and Lie brackets are simplified and rigid body motions are represented as vectors instead of matrices. All geometric elements used to model robots are represented as vectors uniformly, and all operations are modeled as algebraic operations with explicit geometric meaning. The validation of the algorithm is presented for the second-order inverse dynamics of the Franka Emika Panda using the algorithm based on PGA and the algorithm based on product of exponentials (POE) respectively. The proposed algorithm is 15\% faster than the POE-based algorithm with correct results. It turns out that the kinematics part of the algorithm saves 69.82\% multiplications and 73.58\% additions than that in the POE-based algorithm. The relation between PGA and other popular concepts in robotics, such as dual quaternions, is also discussed.},

Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel's waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, CFD or model test data.

Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification. Thus, appropriate model structures can be selected according to the intended frequency range of application to meet the modeling accuracy requirements.},

The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong `destabilizing' yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels---promotion of flow separation---can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.},

  abstract = {Fuel is one of the highest cost items while operating a ship, and its combustion results in air emissions polluting environments. Finding ways to increase shipping operations efficiency without compromising the provided service quality is necessary for economic and environmental reasons. This study first used data analysis to find hidden information in one-year navigation data of a double-ended ferry operated along the Swedish coast. The case study ferry was operated using both bow and stern engines partly loaded. A new feature of the power ratio is defined to describe the influence of engine power allocation on total fuel consumption. Then, different machine learning methods are used to establish the ship's total fuel consumption model due to influences of external factors such as wind and sea currents, etc., together with the power ratio. The established machine learning model is used to find the most efficient operation of allocating power to different engines. It shows that, in theory, up to 35\% fuel savings can be achieved for the case study vessel. These findings can further aid with the operational planning for the scope of Eco-driving.Double-ended ferries are an alternative to bridges or tunnels for transporting passengers and cars over water. They are used for commuting in big cities like New York (Siferry 2022), London (TRL 2022), and connecting islands along the coast. Double-ended ferries can achieve this task on short routes where maneuverability may be difficult (Waterhouse, 2016), and relieve road congestion (Leung et al., 2017). The objective in maritime transport is to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 40\% by 2030 and to pursue efforts to reach 70\% reduction by 2050, compared to the 2008 setup by IMO (2018). Maritime authorities also push regional ferries to become more environmentally friendly and save fuel costs. It becomes important to investigate how to operate these vessels to reduce energy consumption. For this purpose, a fundamental problem is establishing a reliable performance model to describe those ferries' fuel consumption in terms of their operational profiles, such as allocation of engine load, ship speed, etc. Different models have been researched in the maritime community to address this problem.}

Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.},

We especially focus on a low-speed maneuver such as the final phase in berthing to achieve automatic berthing control. Accurate dynamic modeling with minimum modeling error is highly desired to establish a model-based control system. We propose a new loss function that reduces the effect of the noise included in the training data. Besides, we revealed the following facts---an RNN that ignores the memory before a certain time improved the prediction accuracy compared with the ``standard'' RNN, and the manual~random maneuver test was effective in obtaining an accurate berthing maneuver model. In addition, several low-speed free running model tests were performed for the scale model of the M.V. Esso Osaka. As a result, this paper showed that the proposed method using a neural network model could accurately represent low-speed maneuvering motions.},

However, creating an advanced model that comprehensively represents the system and its interaction with dynamic environments has always been challenging. Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deficiency and improve model fidelity, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel. From the ship modeling perspective, this study provides new insights by bridging the gap between two separate domains: model-based and data-driven.},

In this paper, a support vector machine method is proposed for the hydrodynamic parameter identification of a nonlinear maneuvering model for a surface vessel. To improve the stability and generalization performance of the identification model, multiple zigzag maneuvering datasets are included as training data. The 3-DOF hydrodynamic derivatives are identified and validated by the multiple support vector regression model. The generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear model is explored by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the original maneuvering data on the evaluation dataset, a dataset that contains separate variable zigzag and turning circle maneuvers tests. The satisfactory agreements between predicted motions and original motions demonstrate the validity and generalization capability of the proposed parameter identification method.},

To diminish the parameter drift and identify the model parameters more accurately, a better understanding of the characteristics of collinearity is necessary. System identification is one of the effective modeling methods in the study of ship manoeuvrability. This paper aims at quantifying and analyzing the collinearity in the modeling of ship manoeuvring motion by using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). By utilizing the multiple datasets including those from zigzag and turning tests and the combinations of manoeuvres, as well as the data processed by D-optimizing design or difference method, the VIF is applied to quantify the severity of collinearity of different model structures. The results show that the selected manoeuvring models have high collinearity under the data of single standard manoeuvre. The pre-processed test data and an appropriate model structure can alleviate the collinearity, hence to diminish the parameter drift. However, the collinearity of the selected models cannot be eliminated. Some suggestions are given for selecting more appropriate training data and mathematical model structures of ship manoeuvring to accurately estimate the model parameters.},

To be specific, the SDN-HP model is incrementally trained from an empty-hidden-node fuzzy neural network with recurrent velocities as inputs and outputs, and the rudder angle as exogenous command. With the aid of fuzzy neuron generation criteria, the SDN grows with increasing fuzzy rules such that fast-dynamics of ship velocities can be in-time fitted. To balance training accuracy and prediction generalization, hierarchical pruning mechanism is created by defining a new concept of fuzzy rule intensity, in order that hidden nodes with insignificant contributions can be dynamically removed, thereby enabling dynamics abstraction with parsimonious structure. With the aid of reference model of Esso Osaka tanker and KVLCC2 database, the SDN-HP model is sufficiently trained and applied to free-running maneuvering prediction in on-line manners. Experimental results show that the proposed SDN-HP framework achieves remarkable fast-dynamics prediction ability and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning paradigm, e.g., LSTM and GRU.},

  abstract = {Maritime transport plays a vital role in economic development. To establish a vessel scheduling model, accurate ship maneuvering models should be used to optimize the strategy and maximize the economic benefits. The use of nonparametric modeling techniques to identify ship maneuvering systems has attracted considerable attention. The Gaussian process has high precision and strong generalization ability in fitting nonlinear functions and requires less training data, which is suitable for ship dynamic model identification. Compared with other machine learning methods, the most obvious advantage of the Gaussian process is that it can provide the uncertainty of prediction. However, most studies on ship modeling and prediction do not consider the uncertainty propagation in Gaussian processes. In this paper, a moment-matching-based approach is applied to address the problem. The proposed identification scheme for ship maneuvering systems is verified by container ship simulation data and experimental data from the Workshop on Verification and Validation of Ship Maneuvering Simulation Methods (SIMMAN) database. The results indicate that the identified model is accurate and shows good generalization performance. The uncertainty of ship motion prediction is well considered based on the uncertainty propagation technology.},

  abstract = {The design of maritime traffic simulators, model-based controllers, and maritime autonomous surface ships require accurate ship dynamic models. Using different nonparametric methods to identify a ship dynamic model using measurement data is a popular research topic. Among the proposed nonparametric models, the Gaussian process (GP) approach is a high-accuracy nonparametric modeling technique, and it can provide the uncertainty of the prediction. However, the high computational complexity of the GP restricts its further application, especially for online learning. Here, we present a novel online identification scheme, namely, the online fast noisy input Gaussian process (online-FNIGP) to identify ship response models. To avoid a high computational burden and the influence of noise, the fully independent training conditional (FITC) algorithm is introduced to the noisy input Gaussian process (NIGP), and it can significantly reduce the computational complexity. The developed scheme can incorporate new noisy measurements online and make fast predictions. The proposed method is verified by two examples: a simulation zigzag test with a parametric container ship and a random maneuver experiment with an unmanned surface vessel. For comparison with the proposed model, a regular Gaussian process is implemented to validate the developed approach. Both the simulation study results and the experimental study results indicate that the developed scheme is a powerful online identification tool for ship maneuvering systems. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on~``standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions'' was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called ``MMG standard method''. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

Firstly, the second-order nonlinear manoeuvring response model of unmanned marine vehicle is discretized by the difference method, and the corresponding data are collected by the manoeuvring motion simulation of the response model. Secondly, the discrete response model is transformed into an augmented state vector based on extended Kalman filter, and the optimal estimation of the state vector is calculated to identify the parameters. And then, the discrete response model is transformed into a support vector machine-based regression model, the collected data are processed and a set of support vectors are obtained to further identify the parameters of the response model. Finally, by comparing the simulation experiments' results from the original model and the identification model, the recognition results-based extended Kalman filter and support vector machine are analysed and some research results are obtained.

The ONRT vessel is taken as the study object, and numerical simulations are conducted to provide the training, validation and testing datasets. The superiority of the proposed random maneuver over the standard zig-zag maneuver is demonstrated by a contrastive study where the excitation signals from the random maneuver and the 20{$^\circ$}/20{$^\circ$} zig-zag maneuver are used for training the model separately. To examine the robustness of the proposed modeling method and the identified model, three levels of white noise are added into the raw simulation data for training the model. To explore the effectiveness and generalization ability of the identified model on different motion patterns of ship maneuvering, course-keeping, course-changing, and turning motions are examined separately. The results demonstrate that the model trained by the excitation signals of the random maneuver has better generalization ability and robustness, verifying the feasibility and practicality of the proposed modeling method.},

In the present study, the effect of oblique flow on propeller lateral loads is numerically investigated based on URANS method, coupled with SST k-{$\omega$} turbulent model and sliding mesh method. An 82, 000 DWT bulk carrier with a single right-handed screw is computed. Both open water and behind-hull conditions are simulated for a range of drift angles from -20 to 20{$^\circ$}. The lateral loads in open water increase with the drift angle increasing in a slightly non-linear trend. However, the behind-hull results are quite different from that in open water. At behind-hull conditions, the horizontal loads monotonously, non-linearly increase as the drift angle increases, while the vertical loads peak at the -5 deg drift angle (corresponding to the transverse flow coming from the portside). In large drift angles, the behind-hull lateral loads reach a larger percentage of the axial loads compared with the open-water results. Scale effect is also investigated by simulating the behind-hull flows with three scales. It is revealed that the increase in scales causes a slight decrease on the horizontal loads independently of drift angles, while it causes a remarkable increase and decrease on the vertical components for positive and negative drift angles, respectively.},

At the pre-processing stage, ship maneuvering prediction based on CFD codes solving the RANSE are with successful applications. However, the work of obtaining the hydrodynamic derivatives and maneuvering coefficients needs to deal with water surface effects and propeller rotating motion, which is very time-consuming. Thereby, it is necessary to explore an appropriate CFD application strategy for ship maneuvering prediction, to balance the numerical accuracy and time costs. In this paper, a self-built low-speed ship motion control experimental platform, 'QiuXin V', modified from a harbor tug, is studied. Double-body assumption combined with discretized propeller method is adopted to perform series of virtual captive model tests and self propulsion tests, to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives, thruster performance, and maneuvering coefficients in straight moving conditions, while the flow attributes associated with the ducted thruster are predicted with empirical methods. Moreover, a modified steering force model is introduced to improve the maneuvering model accuracy. Non-disturbance turning and zigzag maneuvers are performed and compared with free-running model tests. Results show acceptable model accuracy and confirm the feasibility of the adopted integrated method in predicting the ASD ship maneuverability under low-speed conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the predictability limit of day-to-day weather phenomena such as midlatitude winter storms and summer monsoonal rainstorms is crucial to numerical weather prediction (NWP). This predictability limit is studied using unprecedented high-resolution global models with ensemble experiments of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; 9-km operational model) and identical-twin experiments of the U.S. Next-Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS; 3 km). Results suggest that the predictability limit for midlatitude weather may indeed exist and is intrinsic to the underlying dynamical system and instabilities even if the forecast model and the initial conditions are nearly perfect. Currently, a skillful forecast lead time of midlatitude instantaneous weather is around 10 days, which serves as the practical predictability limit. Reducing the current-day initial-condition uncertainty by an order of magnitude extends the deterministic forecast lead times of day-to-day weather by up to 5 days, with much less scope for improving prediction of small-scale phenomena like thunderstorms. Achieving this additional predictability limit can have enormous socioeconomic benefits but requires coordinated efforts by the entire community to design better numerical weather models, to improve observations, and to make better use of observations with advanced data assimilation and computing techniques.},

  abstract = {The effect of roll damping on the prediction of a ship's motion is significant. A method based on the 3-D CFD approach for calculating the roll damping of a ship is proposed in this paper. The free decay experiments of 4 different types of ships at zero velocity are carried out. The roll damping coefficients are calculated and compared with the experiment results, with a good agreement. It is shown that the method adopted in this paper could be used to simulate the free rolling of a ship in the calm water at zero velocity very well and with good, stable accuracy for the prediction of the roll damping, and also with good applicability. This method may be further developed for the prediction of a full scale ship in the future.},

  abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full-scale or free- running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real-time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method (RLS), are exerted for on-line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for SVM to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de-noised motion data as input-output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using RLS and SVM-RLS, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from RLS and SVM-RLS have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for SVM positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, SVM-RLS using data de-noised by EMD shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

  abstract = {Abstract   A nonparametric identification method based on    {$\nu$}   (`nu')-support vector regression (   {$\nu$}   -SVR) is proposed to establish robust models of ship maneuvering motion in an easy-to-operate way. Assisted by the kernel trick, the nonlinear model learns implicitly in high-dimensional feature space without a priori model structure. The    {$\nu$}   -SVR controls the sparsity automatically, resulting in high efficiency. To improve the practicality, a parameter tuning scheme combining the hold-out validation and the simulation of dynamic processes is designed to avoid overfitting. Taking the KVLCC2 ship as the study object, the experimental data from the SIMMAN database are used to evaluate the method. The selection and pre-processing of training data are discussed. The identified model shows good generalization performance in the prediction of multiple maneuvers not involved in the training set, verifying the effectiveness of the method.},
