\section{Datasets}\label{sec:datasets}
The data used in this thesis have been summarized in \autoref{tab:datasets}, which specifies the papers in which they were used, the testing facilities from which they were collected, and their corresponding references.
Data from the 250 roll decay tests at SSPA could not be published, due to IP rights. The wPCC dataset was published in two versions, A and B. wPCC A was used in Paper \ref{pap:pit} where the motions were expressed in the center of gravity. wPCC B was used in Papers \ref{pap:physics} and \ref{pap:vct} were the motions were instead expressed at the origin, as defined in \autoref{sec:manoeuvring}.
