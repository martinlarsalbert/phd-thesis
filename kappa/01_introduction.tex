\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter begins with an overview of the research subject, followed by a literature review that outlines the motivation, objectives, assumptions, and limitations of this study. The chapter concludes with an outline of the thesis.

The term \say{model} is frequently used in this thesis, but it carries different meanings across various engineering disciplines. To avoid confusion, this thesis adopts a more precise definition by distinguishing between \say{model structure} -- defined for mathematical models by \say{model equations} -- and \say{identified model}, which refers to the complete model, including the identified parameters within the model equations.
