This chapter provides a brief background on the research subject followed by a review of the literature that outlines the motivation and objectives, and the assumptions and limitations of this research. The chapter ends with an outline of the thesis.

The term \say{model} is used extensively in this thesis; but it has different meanings within different fields of engineering; therefore, to avoid confusion, this thesis uses a more strict definition by differentiating between \say{the model structure} -- which is defined for mathematical models by \say{model equations} -- and \say{the identified model} -- which is the complete model, also including the identified parameters within the model equations.
