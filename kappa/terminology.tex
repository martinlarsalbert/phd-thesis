\section{Model terminology} \label{sec:terminology}
The term model has different meanings within different fields of engineering.
This thesis therefore uses a more strict definition by differentiating between the \say{model structure} -- which is defined for mathematical models by the \say{model equations} -- and the \say{identified model} -- which is the complete model, also including the identified parameters within the model equations.
