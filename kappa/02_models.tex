The dynamics of a ship comprise a variety of forces and motions in the six degrees of freedom (6DOF): surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw. Heave and pitch motions are neglected in calm water conditions to ensure that a four degrees of freedom (4DOF) model can sufficiently express the ship's dynamics. Models for roll and the manoeuvring model for the remaining DOFs are presented in section \ref{sec:roll} and section \ref{sec:manoeuvring model}.
