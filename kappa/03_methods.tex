%Section comments: There were more changes related to objective language and directional words. There is a missing term near line 13.
The system identification of rigid body ship dynamics can be simplified into parameter estimation if parameterized physical models is assumed as the most appropriate model from a collection of candidate models.
The parameter estimations for roll motion and manoeuvring are presented in \autoref{sec:_roll} and \autoref{sec:_VMM}. The most appropriate models are selected in the model development process described in \autoref{sec:cross_validation}.
