\subsection{System identification from captive tests} \label{sec:literature_VCT}
Identifying a manoeuvring model from CMT or VCT is a great challenge, or as \textcite{sutulo_algorithm_2014} says that \say{All practical manoeuvring mathematical models are highly schematised and although in principle can be tuned to provide a satisfactory reproduction of the true motion, there are no simple theoretical methods for estimating their parameters}.

Often the models are tuned manually before being implemented in bridge simulators, although such approaches are rarely even mentioned in the literature \cite{sutulo_algorithm_2014}.
