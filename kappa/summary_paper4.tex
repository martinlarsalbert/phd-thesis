\subsection*{Scope and motivations}
Minimizing the number of derivatives is often a good idea to avoid overfitting irrelevant data, following the prejudice approach that ''Nature is simple'' \cite{ljungPerspectivesSystemIdentification2010}. However, this could also lead to model structures with limited applicability, as certain regression terms may only become significant in special conditions like sailing in wind \cite{abkowitzMEASUREMENTHYDRODYNAMICCHARACTERISTICS1980}.

It was shown in Paper \ref{pap:pit} that it is possible to identify a model from calm water free running model test with inverse dynamics regression (\autoref{sec:IDR}) together with a cross validation technique to ensure good generalization so that the model can predict other kinds of maneuvers with very good accuracy. However, it was soon discovered that these models did not generalize well when wind forces were added to the simulations. This problem was addressed in Paper \ref{pap:physics}.

Paper \ref{pap:physics} uses two modular manoeuvring models. One of the models is a physics uninformed (PU) model which was a completely data driven model, similarly to the models used in the previous paper (Paper \ref{pap:pit}).
The other model was a physics informed (PI) model, where prior knowledge about rudder hydrodynamics has been added to guide the identification towards a more physically correct model. 
The models had identical prediction models for the hull and propeller forces but different models for the rudder forces. The PI model had a deterministic semi-empirical rudder model. The PU model had a data-driven mathematical rudder model. Except for the changed rudder models, the ship manoeuvring models were similar to the MMG model \cite{yasukawaIntroductionMMGStandard2015}, with some minor enhancements; The surge velocity was for instance expressed as a perturbed velocity (see \autoref{sec:prime_system}) allowing for higher order resistance coefficients.

A brief description of the workflow of Paper \ref{pap:physics} is shown in \autoref{fig:methodology}.
The PI and PU models were identified in free-running model tests using inverse dynamics and regression. To assess physical correctness, a reference model was established, where the PI model was instead identified on a VCT data set. This reference model, based on CFD, was assumed to be a sufficiently correct representation of the ship's physics.
Verification and comparisons between the models were carried out in the free-sailing model tests.

It was investigated if the introduction of a deterministic semi-empirical rudder model in the PI model would reduce the multicollinearity and enhance the generalization.

\subsection*{Results and concluding remarks}
Force predictions using reference, PI, and PU models for the states during one of the zigzag10/10 tests with wPCC were compared with the inverse dynamics forces for the same test in \autoref{fig:ID_zigzag10}. The PI and PU models predicted the same total yawing moment $N_D$ and sway force $Y_D$ as the reference model. However, the decomposition of this total yawing moment into components of the hull $N_H$ and the rudder $N_R$ differed significantly between the PU model and the PI and reference models, which were quite similar to each other.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{kappa/images/results.ID_zigzag10.pdf} \caption{ID estimations of $Y_D$ and $N_D$ during a zigzag10/10 model test compared with model predictions.} \label{fig:ID_zigzag10} \end{figure}

The hull forces can be further decomposed into contributions from the drift of the vessel, through the sway velocity $v$, and contributions from the yaw rate $r$, as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_regression_N_decomposition}. It appears that almost all the yawing moments $N_H$ depend on $r$ for the PU model, and almost all the sway force $Y_H$ is generated by $v$. This contrasts with the other two models, where both $v$ and $r$ contribute to $N_H$ and $Y_H$.

Thus, the PU model not only has an incorrect decomposition between rudder and hull forces, but it also incorrectly decomposes the drift and yaw rate contributions within the hull force model. However, this is not a significant problem during the zigzag tests, where the drift and yaw rate are highly correlated, as seen from the phase plot in \autoref{fig:phase_portrait}. This correlation can also explain why the completely data-driven model from the previous paper (Paper \ref{pap:pit}) achieves such good results despite the erroneous decomposition.

However, when the ship is exposed to wind, causing changes in drift, the erroneous decomposition of the PU model becomes apparent, as shown in \autoref{fig:result_wind_state}. The PI model aligns better with the reference model in the wind state. Introducing a semi-empirical rudder model seems to have guided the identification toward a more physically accurate model, with lower multicollinearity and better generalization from calm water zigzag tests to wind conditions.
