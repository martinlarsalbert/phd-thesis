% Multicollinearity
\textcite{abkowitz_measurement_1980} was only able to combat the observed cancelation effect by eliminating 'inconvenient' terms, which, however, could lead to models with limited applicability, as certain regression terms may only become significant in special conditions like sailing in wind.

% Persistance of excitation
