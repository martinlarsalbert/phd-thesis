% Multicollinearity
\textcite{abkowitz_measurement_1980} was only able to combat the observed cancelation effect by eliminating 'inconvenient' terms, which, however, could lead to models with limited applicability, as certain regression terms may only become significant in special conditions like sailing in wind.

% Persistance of excitation


\textcite{yoon_identification_2003} proposed estimation before modeling, also known as the two-step method, which was also used by \textcite{sutulo_algorithm_2014}.
