\chapter{Summary of papers}\label{ch:results}
\noindent This chapter presents a summary of the papers appended to this thesis, which includes research activities and a selection of the most relevant results. The relationships between the papers are summarized in \autoref{fig:papers}. The first two papers focus on the roll motion, in which the work conducted using Ikeda's method in Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping} is continued in Paper \ref{pap:ikeda}. 
The work exploring inverse dynamics that was initiated in the roll motion papers continued in the remaining manoeuvring papers.
Multicollinearity was found to be a significant challenge in Paper \ref{pap:pit}, and was initially addressed through model truncation.
However, model generalization may be reduced when model truncation is used, which was shown in Paper \ref{pap:physics}. Instead, the multicollinearity between the hull and rudder forces was mitigated by introducing a semi-empirical rudder model. The multicollinearity between the drift and yaw rate dependent forces was subsequently addressed in Paper \ref{pap:vct}. In addition, see \autoref{tab:objectives} in \autoref{sec:motivation} for a discussion of the relationship between these papers and the research objectives of this thesis.
