\section{Rudder models} \label{sec:rudders}
It has become evident during this investigation that having an accurate rudder model is very important to obtain good accuracy of the total manoeuvring model. Polynomial rudder models were used in Paper \ref{pap:pit}, which can well describe the rudder forces if a sufficient degree of polynomials is used. However, these models introduce multicollinearity to the model which is a great problem in system identification with parameter estimation from inverse dynamics (see \autoref{sec:IDR}); it is basically hard to distinguish between forces generated by the hull and the rudder when only the total force acting on the ship can be observed. Instead of using a data-driven rudder model, a semi-empirical deterministic rudder model (see \autoref{sec:semi-empirical}) was therefore introduced in Paper \ref{pap:physics}. The rudder forces were calculated on the basis of the rudder main particulars and preset coefficients from the literature.

A third rudder model was introduced in Paper \ref{pap:vct} as a modified version of the MMG rudder model \cite{yasukawaIntroductionMMGStandard2015}. This model was found to be easier to adopt when very rich information about the rudder forces was available from the VCT data.
