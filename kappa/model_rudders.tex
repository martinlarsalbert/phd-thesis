\section{Rudder models} \label{sec:rudders}
It has become evident during this research that having an accurate rudder model is very important to get good accuracy of the total manoeuvring model. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to finding the best rudder model. Simple polynomial rudder models were used in Paper \ref{pap:pit}. However, these models introduce a lot of multicollinearity
