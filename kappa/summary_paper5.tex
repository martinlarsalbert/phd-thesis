\subsection*{Scope and motivations}
We can never find the true model of a system, but how close can we get? The reference model from \ref{pap:physics} was assumed to be close to the physically correct true model of ship manoeuvring dynamics. This model was developed with VCT (see \ref{sec:VCT}), which is based on physical first principles through CFD calculations. Paper \ref{pap:vct} investigates the identification of manoeuvring with VCT more closely, with the aim to get even closer to the true model.

Manoeuvring models were developed for two WASP test cases with large rudders. The models were identified by conducting VCT to obtain hydrodynamic damping coefficients and by conducting pure yaw and pure sway tests in FNPF to obtain the added masses using the Fourier series method \cite{sakamoto_cfd_2021}. The identified force models were compared with the inverse dynamics forces of the zigzag tests to identify possible weak spots within the models.
