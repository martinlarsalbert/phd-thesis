\subsection{Semi-empirical roll damping with Ikeda's method}
\label{sec:ikeda}
Ikeda's method \cite{ikeda_components_1978} divides roll damping into five damping components: the friction component $B_F$, the eddy component $B_E$, the lift component $B_L$, the wave component $B_W$, and the bilge keel component $B_{BK}$, as in the following Eq.(\ref{eq:ikeda}), 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ikeda}
B_{44} = B_F + B_E + B_L + B_W + B_{BK}
\end{equation}
where the wave and eddy components require strip-theory based hydrodynamic analysis to obtain the ship's shape coefficients.
