\section{Roll model parameter estimation} \label{sec:_roll}
\noindent Parameter estimation can be applied to identify the roll damping parameters ($B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$) and stiffness parameters ($C_1$, $C_3$, $C_5$) in the parameterized roll motion model structures from the previous chapter (\autoref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_linear}, \autoref{eq:roll_decay_equation_himeno_quadratic_b} and \autoref{eq:roll_decay_equation_cubic}). These equations do not have unique solutions because each equation can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor to obtain a new valid solution. Inertia is therefore excluded to obtain unique solutions. This is achieved by normalizing the equations by the total roll inertia $A_{44}$, as seen in \autoref{eq:roll_decay_nonedim_a44}, for the linear model.

\noindent The identified normalized damping and stiffness parameters $B_{1A}$ and $C_{1A}$ can be expressed in dimensional units by multiplication with the normalization factor $A_{44}$. If $A_{44}$ is unknown before hand, it can be calculated using \autoref{eq:A_44_eq} \cite{piehlShipRollDamping2016}, assuming that the meta center height $GM$ is known.

\noindent The frequency $\omega_0$ can be obtained with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the roll signal. 
Two methods for parameter estimation have been investigated: the \say{derivation approach}, referred to in \textcite{imo1200InterimGuidelines2006}, and the \say{integration approach} used in \textcite{soderAssessmentShipRoll2019} which are both described in the next subsections. 

\subsection{Inverse dynamics regression}\label{sec:derivation_approach}
In inverse dynamics regression (called derivation approach in Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping}), \autoref{eq:roll_decay_nonedim_a44} is treated as a linear regression problem, where the states ($\phi$, $\dot{\phi}$, $\ddot{\phi}$) are known and the parameters $B_1$ and $C_1$ must be regressed. Only roll angle $\phi$ is known from the experimental data, which means that the velocity and acceleration $\dot{\phi}$, $\ddot{\phi}$ also must be approximated (note that this is done with numerical differentiation in Paper \ref{pap:rolldamping} and with the extended Kalman filter (EKF) in Paper \ref{pap:pit}).
A least squares fit is applied to the roll motion equation to identify the damping and stiffness parameters.

\subsection{Integration approach}\label{sec:integration_approach}
In the integration approach, \autoref{eq:roll_decay_nonedim_a44} is solved as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for many estimated sets of parameters until the solution converges. This method is time-consuming, and convergence is not guaranteed. However, the advantage is that only roll angle $\phi$ is needed.
