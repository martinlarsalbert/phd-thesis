\subsection{Multicollinearity and generalization of models} \label{sec:multicollinearity}
The drift effect of the hydrodynamic coefficients is inevitable in modeling of ship manoeuvring motions by using the system identification. The drifts of hydrodynamic coefficients result from the so-called multicollinearity, meaning that if the input variables of a regression model are firmly linearly dependent on each other, the regression results of their coefficients may be incorrect \cite{luo_parameter_2016}.
