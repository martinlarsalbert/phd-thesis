\section{Inverse dynamics regression} \label{sec:IDR}
Parameter estimation from CMT or VCT is the classic way to identify parameters within a manoeuvring model. However, a model can also be identified from time series obtained with FRMTs or full-scale maneuvers. Instead of, as in the CMT or VCT, having direct measured forces, the forces can instead be estimated with inverse dynamics (see \autoref{sec:ID}).
