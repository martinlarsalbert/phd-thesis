\subsection{Modified quadratic MMG rudder model}
A modified quadratic MMG rudder model is proposed in Paper \ref{pap:vct}, with two enhancements to the original MMG rudder model \cite{yasukawaIntroductionMMGStandard2015}. The first enhancement is to add the rudder initial inflow angle $\gamma_0$ to the calculation of the effective inflow angle to the rudder $\alpha_R$, by replacing equation 21 in \textcite{yasukawaIntroductionMMGStandard2015} with the modified equation (\autoref{eq:alpha_R2}). This allows the rudder model to produce a side force in the straight ahead condition, due to unsymmetrical flow from the propeller. 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alpha_R2}
    %\input{equations/mathematical_model_kinetics.alpha_R_semiempirical}
    \alpha_{R} = \delta + \underbrace{\gamma_{0}}_{\text{ proposed}} + \operatorname{atan}{\left(\frac{v_{R}}{u_{R}} \right)}
\end{equation}
The rudder transverse velocity $v_R$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gamma_R2}
    v_{R} = V \beta_{R} \gamma_{R}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_R$ is the effective inflow angle to the rudder as function of both the drift angle $\beta$ and yaw rate $r$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:beta_R}
    \beta_{R} = \beta - \frac{l_{R} r}{V}
\end{equation}
where $l_R$ is a lever arm to the rudder that is treated as an experimental constant.
The other enhancement is to allow for a quadratic relationship between the flow straightening coefficient $\gamma_R$ and the effective inflow angle $\beta_R$, by introducing two new coefficients $\gamma_{R2neg}$, and $\gamma_{R2pos}$ as shown in:  
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gamma_R2}
    \gamma_{R} = \begin{cases} \overbrace{\gamma_{R2 neg} \left|{\beta_{R}}\right|}^{proposed} +   
    \gamma_{R neg} & \text{for}\: \beta_{R} \leq 0 \\\gamma_{R2 pos} \left| 
    {\beta_{R}}\right| + \gamma_{R pos} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\end{equation}
