	doi = {10.2534/jjasnaoe.24.167},
	abstract = {Ship manoeuvrability has been generally predicted based on 3-{DOF} mathematical model. However, medium-high speed ships such as containerships and passenger ferries make sometimes a large roll motion by the steering, which more or less affects on the ship manoeuvrability. Although a lot of researches have been done about the effect of roll motion, the mathematical models of hydrodynamic forces have been proposed individually putting the additional terms of roll angle into the conventional 3-{DOF} mathematical model. This makes the difficulty in the prediction of manoeuvrability.
In this paper, the captive model tests have been performed with a container ship and a passenger ferry. In order to grasp the characteristics of the effect of roll angle on the conventional 3-{DOF} mathematical model, {CMT}(Circular Motion Test) have been carried out with setting a constant roll angles. And then, the effects of roll angle on the hydrodynamic derivatives have been extracted. From this analysis, the suitable 4-{DOF} mathematical model has been introduced by means of eliminating the less contributing terms of the roll effect. For the validation of the proposed mathematical model, free running model tests were carried out with several {GM} and ship’s speed since the roll angle during a manoeuvring is affected by them. After comparing simulated results by the proposed 4-{DOF} mathematical model and the results of free running model test, it is found that the effect of {GM} and ship’s speed on turning trajectories or the overshoot of Z-test can be well predicted by the proposed 4-{DOF} mathematical model.},

	abstract = {We present a modular mathematical model and a reference technique for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single- and twin-screw propulsion ships. Heave, roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non-linear unified seakeeping/maneuvering time-domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6–{DoF} model in the form of critical damping and natural period. Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel’s waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, {CFD} or model test data. Results are validated against experiments available for zig-zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations. It is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneu­ vering trajectories of existing or new-build vessels and for estimating the evasive velocity in way of contact before grounding.},

The methods are compared using results from a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships and a smaller set of predictions in which the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the {SI}-method. Thus, the {SI}-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave-damping in the {SI}-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the {SI}-method were proposed based on regression, which gave about the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.},

The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong ‘destabilizing’ yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels—promotion of flow separation—can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.},

	title = {Fully Nonlinear Unsteady Three-Dimensional Boundary Element Method for Ship Motions in Waves},
	url = {https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/180980},
	abstract = {The prediction of the behavior of ships in a seaway has been an important topic in ship design since the beginning of modern naval architecture. In recent years, computer simulations using numerical methods based on mathematical models of the ship hydrodynamics problem has become a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in this field. A large variety of methods with different levels of sophistication and accuracy already exist today, all being suitable for specific problems. However, with the current trend of larger, more advanced and optimized designs and focus turning more and more towards safety and energy efficiency, nonlinear phenomena are becoming more important and many of the traditional methods have problems in producing accurate results for certain cases due to assumptions and neglected physical effects in the underlying mathematical model. The overall objective of this project is the development and implementation of a fully nonlinear unsteady three-dimensional boundary element method for ship motion analysis, applicable to problems with a high degree of nonlinearities while still being suitable for practical use. The method is capable of predicting wave induced loads and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i.e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level and self interaction between the forward speed flow field as well as radiated and diffracted waves. This thesis presents the mathematical model, the numerical method and numerical results obtained from the application of the method to a number of relevant test cases. Results from the application of the method are provided, including the propagation of a regular long-crested wave, the wave resistance problem in calm water and the radiation and diffraction problem in regular and irregular head sea. The results are limited to heave and pitch motions and are compared with analytical or experimental data, numerical results from other methods or, in some cases, both. The method has proved to be able to capture strong nonlinear effects in heave and pitch motions and its feasibility as a qualified analysis tool for such cases has been demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Maritime autonomous surface ships ({MASS}) require accurate future state projection to initiate collision-avoidance manoeuvres. Forecasts of the vessels’ trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the mathematical manoeuvring model, which is an essential component of their hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship {KCS} as an object of study, this paper adopts a 4-{DOF} modular-type manoeuvring ({MMG}) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential ﬂow solver {WASIM}, which is based on Rankine panel method. The computed vessel trajectories and motions are compared with available literature results and show good correlation.},

permits predicting ship motions and therefore advancing control safety and maneuverability for the offshore ship

hydrodynamic coefficients to establish highly accurate mathematical models. In this paper, a support vector machine
method is proposed for the hydrodynamic parameter identification of a nonlinear maneuvering model for a surface
vessel. To improve the stability and generalization performance of the identification model, multiple zigzag
maneuvering datasets are included as training data. The 3-{DOF} hydrodynamic derivatives are identified and
validated by the multiple support vector regression model. The generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear
model is explored by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the original maneuvering data on the
evaluation dataset, a dataset that contains separate variable zigzag and turning circle maneuvers tests. The
satisfactory agreements between predicted motions and original motions demonstrate the validity and generalization
capability of the proposed parameter identification method.},

The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.},

Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial {RANS} solver based on a finite volume method ({FVM}) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using {VOF} (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with {URANS} approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz’s non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature. In addition, viscous effects have been investigated using Eulerian approach for several static drift cases.},

The model was fixed in the surge, sway, roll and yaw directions but free to heave and pitch. This setup gave possibility to measure the most important forces and still having a realistic displacement, or wetted surface, for the ship model. This test methodology gives opportunity to use a relatively limited number of model trials for identifying conditions where surf riding and broaching-to are likely to occur. The purpose with the trials is also to validate numerical computations of hydrodynamic forces. • Numerical computations using a code based on a modified strip theory and semiempirical methods. • A comparison of computations and the experimental work.},

	abstract = {Modeling is the most important component in predictive controller design. It should predict outputs precisely and fast. Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible. In a good ship model the standard deviation of a particular coefﬁcient should not exceed 10\% of its value. Fitting the validation data to 80\% for short-term prediction and 65\% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to ﬁt the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identiﬁcation procedure is proposed. In the ﬁrst step a predictive linear model is identiﬁed conventionally, and then coefﬁcients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefﬁcient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100\% of their values to approximately 5\% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71\% and 54\% to 89\% and 76\%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufﬁciently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.},

Despite its short computation time, system-based simulations need many captive model tests to estimate the hydrodynamic and rudder maneuvering coefficients used in the system-based mathematical model and the results have difficulty to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental data. Herein system identification techniques (extended Kalman filtering and constrained least square method using generalized reduced gradient algorithm) are used to predict the maneuvering coefficients from several {EFD}, systems based and {CFD} free-running trials. {CFD} gives not only the ship motions but also the total and component hydrodynamic forces/moments during the free-running simulations, which is helpful for estimating the maneuvering coefficients. Several types of free-running (turning circle, zigzag and large angle zigzag) tests are conducted using {EFD} and {CFD} to examine which free-running trial gives the best maneuvering coefficients using system identification. Also several free-running data are combined together for parallel processing. The set of maneuvering coefficients estimated by the constrained least square method using combined {CFD} free-running trial data show the most generalized results which covers a wide range of maneuvers.},

An inverse problem was formulated to solve the first-kind Volterra-type integral equation using sets of motion signal data. However, this numerical approach leads to solution instability due to noisy data. Regularization is a technique that can overcome the lack of stability; hence, Landweber’s regularization method was employed in this study. The L-curve criterion was used to select regularization parameters (number of iterations) that correspond to the accuracy of the inverse solution. The solution of this method is a discrete moment, which is the summation of nonlinear restoring, nonlinear damping, and nonlinear mass moment of inertia. A zero-crossing detection technique is used in the nonparametric system identification method on a pair of measured data of the angular velocity and angular acceleration of a ship, and the detections are matched with the inverse solution at the same discrete times. The procedure was demonstrated through a numerical model of a full nonlinear free-roll motion system in still water to examine and prove its accuracy. Results show that the method effectively and efficiently identified the functional form of the nonlinear added moment of inertia and damping moment.},

	abstract = {A novel identification approach to nonlinear ship manoeuvring models based on Bayes' rule is presented. The empirical Bayesian method is used to clean simulated polluted responses from a 20°/20° zigzag test. Two efficient Bayesian models, conjugate regression and semi-conjugate regression, are adopted for hydrodynamic parameter identification. To obtain other prior parameters, the Bayesian optimization ({BO}) algorithm is introduced in the Bayesian regression model. By using the identified model and an experimental model based on Blanke's nonlinear four-degrees-of-freedom (4-{DOF}) model, 10°/10° zigzag motion and 35° turning circle manoeuvring are performed. A comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates that both Bayesian regression models have good generalization ability for identification, and that the conjugate Bayesian model has greater prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Operational optimization of ocean vessels, both off-line and in real-time, is becoming increasingly important due to rising fuel cost and added environmental constraints. Accurate and efficient simulation models are needed to achieve maximum energy efficiency. In this paper a grey-box modeling approach for the simulation of ocean vessels is presented. The modeling approach combines conventional analysis models based on physical principles (a white-box model) with a feed forward neural-network (a black-box model). Two different ways of combining these models are presented, in series and in parallel. The results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey-box modeling approach, both serial and parallel approaches, can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white-box model. However, a prediction of the vessel speed is only improved slightly. Furthermore, the results give an indication of the potential advantages of grey-box models, which is extrapolation beyond a given training data set and the incorporation of physical phenomena which are not modeled in the white-box models. Finally, included is a discussion on how to enhance the predictability of the grey-box models as well as updating the neural-network in real-time.},

	abstract = {This thesis is an overview of added resistance in waves, available methods and how a simplified method
can be developed.
Added resistance in waves is indeed a very complicated problem. The present methods, most of them
developed during the 1970s, give reasonable results for head waves. But for quartering and following
waves, the methods have low accuracy, due to uncertainties in strip calculated ship motions for these
cases, and the ability to account for roll and yaw motions.
In this thesis Gerristma and Beukelman’s method and Boese’s method to calculate added resistance is
implemented and validated against published calculation results, from previous implementations. The
implementations are also evaluated against published experimental results in head waves. These
evaluations show that added resistance with good accuracy can be calculated for head waves using
Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method.
This thesis also shows how a simplified method to calculate added resistance in waves can be developed.
This simplified method only uses the ships main particulars to describe the hull. The method is intended
to be used when the entire hull geometry is not available, for instance in the pre-study of a new ship
design. The idea with this method is to estimate transfer functions for added resistance without using strip
calculations. The transfer functions are parameterized with three parameters, peak value, peak frequency
and spreading. Expressions for these parameters are derived with regression analysis, based on analytical
results from Gerritsma and Beukelman’s method. The simplified method has an accuracy of about 25\%,
which is about the same amount that usually can be expected of a method to calculate added resistance in
waves.},

However, the noise in the training data significantly reduces the accuracy in identification and prediction. Here, we present a robust nonparametric system identification technique for a ship maneuvering model based on Gaussian Process ({GP}) regression. To solve the problem caused by noise, the input noisy Gaussian Process ({NIGP}) model is employed, and it can automatically propagate the input uncertainty to the output in the learning model using the Taylor approxi­ mation. Polluted simulation datasets obtained from the numerical model of a parametric container ship are used for training. Zigzag and turning circle maneuvering motions are performed, and a comparison with {GP} and {SVM} is implemented to validate the proposed approach. The results indicate that the developed scheme for system identification of ships is accurate and robust with noisy input.},

	abstract = {Ship maneuvering models are the keys to the research of ship maneuverability, design of ship motion control system and development of ship handling simulators. For various frames of ship maneuvering models, determining the parameters of the models is always a tedious task. System identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models by the system’s input data and output data. In this paper, based on the analysis of ship hydrodynamics, a nonlinear model frame of ship maneuvering is established. System identification theory is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. An algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter theory is proposed to calculate the parameters. In order to gain the system’s input and output data, which is necessary for the parameters identification experiment, turning circle tests and Zig-zag tests are performed on shiphandling simulator and the initial data is collected. Based on the Fixed Interval Kalman Smoothing algorithm, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed to process the raw data of the tests. With this algorithm, the errors introduced during the measurement process are eliminated. Parameters identification experiments are designed to estimate the model parameters, and the ship maneuvering model parameters estimation algorithm is extended to modify the parameters being estimated. Then the model parameters and the ship maneuvering model are determined. Simulation validation was carried out to simulate the ship maneuverability. Comparisons have been made to the simulated data and measured data. The results show that the ship maneuvering model determined by our approach can seasonably reflect the actual motion of ship, and the parameter estimation procedure and algorithms are effective.},

The purpose of the workshop was to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship maneuvering simulation methods including systems- and {CFD}-based methods through systematic quantitative comparisons and validation against {EFD} data for tanker ({KVLCC}), container ship ({KCS}), and surface combatant (5415) hull form test cases. For the {KVLCC} test case, two stern shape variants named {KVLCC}1 and {KVLCC}2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and {CFD} for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided {PMM} and {CMT} data, and two used {CFD} instead. {CFD}-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with {PMM}/{CMT} model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as {PMM}- and {CMT}-based methods, {CFD} based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different {CFD}-based methods such as {RANS}, {URANS}, and {DES}. This paper gives an overview of hulls, model tests, test cases, submissions, comparison results as well as the most important observations and conclusions.},

	abstract = {To predict the manoeuvrability of unmanned marine vehicle and improve its manoeuvrability, the parameters of the manoeuvring model of unmanned marine vehicle need to be obtained. Aiming at the inconvenience of obtaining model parameters under the traditional experimental method, this article studies the parameter identification of unmanned marine vehicle’s manoeuvring model based on extended Kalman filter and support vector machine. Firstly, the second-order nonlinear manoeuvring response model of unmanned marine vehicle is discretized by the difference method, and the corresponding data are collected by the manoeuvring motion simulation of the response model. Secondly, the discrete response model is transformed into an augmented state vector based on extended Kalman filter, and the optimal estimation of the state vector is calculated to identify the parameters. And then, the discrete response model is transformed into a support vector machine-based regression model, the collected data are processed and a set of support vectors are obtained to further identify the parameters of the response model. Finally, by comparing the simulation experiments’ results from the original model and the identification model, the recognition results-based extended Kalman filter and support vector machine are analysed and some research results are obtained. The results of this article will provide a powerful reference for the design of unmanned marine vehicle’s motion control algorithm.},

	abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method ({RLS}), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines ({SVM}), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for {SVM} to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using {RLS} and {SVM}‐{RLS}, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from {RLS} and {SVM}‐{RLS} have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for {SVM} positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, {SVM}‐{RLS} using data de‐noised by {EMD} shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

A Mariner Class vessel is taken as the study object. The time series used in training and testing the network is the simulated data of a series of maneuvers, which is obtained by numerically solving the Abkowitz model using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. A three-layer neural network is built to solve this multivariable regression fitting problem, and only one network model is trained to predict various ship maneuvers. Taking the mean squared error ({MSE}) as the loss function, the network’s weights are optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt ({LM}) algorithm effectively. The trained network is evaluated by several simulation tests, and it is shown that the network achieves good prediction ability and can predict the maneuvering motion as long as the control inputs and initial states of the ship motion are known.},

	abstract = {A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group ({MMG}) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called “{MMG} standard method”. In this article, the {MMG} standard method is introduced. The {MMG} standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. {KVLCC}2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for {KVLCC}2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

The computed hydrodynamic forces and derivatives are compared with the available captive model test data, showing good agreement overall.

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete procedure for sensor compatibility correction of a fixed-wing Unmanned Air Vehicle ({UAV}). The sensors consist of a differential air pressure transducer for airspeed measurement, two airdata vanes installed on an airdata probe for angle of attack ({AoA}) and angle of sideslip ({AoS}) measurement, and an Attitude and Heading Reference System ({AHRS}) that provides attitude angles, angular rates, and acceleration. The procedure is mainly based on a two pass algorithm called the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ({RTS}) smoother, which consists of a forward pass Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) and a backward recursion smoother. On top of that, this paper proposes the implementation of the Wiener Type Filter prior to the {RTS} in order to avoid the complicated process noise covariance matrix estimation. Furthermore, an easy to implement airdata measurement noise variance estimation method is introduced. The method estimates the airdata and subsequently the noise variances using the ground speed and ascent rate provided by the Global Positioning System ({GPS}). It incorporates the idea of data regionality by assuming that some sort of statistical relation exists between nearby data points. Root mean square deviation ({RMSD}) is being employed to justify the sensor compatibility. The result shows that the presented procedure is easy to implement and it improves the {UAV} sensor data compatibility significantly.},

	abstract = {Small {USVs} are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system ({GNSS}) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most {USV} systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two {GNSS} antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small {USV} systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an {RTK} {GNSS} receiver is used. The drawback of the {RTK} solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) aided by {GNSS} latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground ({COG}), speed over ground ({SOG}), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a {USV}. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four {EKF} covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different {GNSS} receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the {EKF} is that the autopilot does not need to use the {COG} and {SOG} measurements from the {GNSS} receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log ({DVL}) to the {EKF} to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state {EKF} is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial {USV} systems.},

However, creating an advanced model that comprehensively represents the system and its interaction with dynamic environments has always been challenging. Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deﬁciency and improve model ﬁdelity, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel. From the ship modeling perspective, this study provides new insights by bridging the gap between two separate domains: model-based and data-driven.},

The basis for the control system is a nonlinear maneuvering model that describes the coupled motions in surge, sway and yaw. In order to follow a predefined path, the ship must be equipped with minimum two actuators that produce a surge force and a yaw moment. Moreover, only two controls are needed to control an under actuated ship in three Degrees Of Freedom ({DOF}). Path following is achieved by a geometric assignment based on a {LOS} projection algorithm for minimization of the cross-track error to the path. The {LOS} algorithm computes heading angle commands to the autopilot system.The desired speed along the path is controlled independently of the heading autopilot. The path-following controller is model based and a nonlinear hydrodynamic model is used to derive the motion control system. A ship case study using a scale model illustrates the path-following capabilities.},

Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.},

	abstract = {Assessing the manoeuvring performances of a ship at a design stage is becoming more important, especially when trying to improve shipping efficiency to reduce fuel consumption.
When designing a hull with appendages, it is necessary to balance hydrodynamic efficiency with manoeuvrability. Therefore, the possibility of simulating a captive test at a design stage will increase the chances of understanding the behaviour of a ship from an early stage in the design process. The current research is based on the evaluation of hydrodynamic efficiency of a hull and appendages in a pure resistance, self-propulsion and in a wind-assisted mode.
The forces and moments acting on the hull and appendages are then analysed and used as inputs for a Virtual Captive Test ({VCT}) [1]. In order to correctly perform a {VCT} and further analyse the performances of a ship with a Velocity Prediction Programme ({VPP}), particular care has been put in correctly capturing the manoeuvrability coefficients. Those are derived with polynomial fittings once the forces and moments acting on the ship are extracted from the Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) simulations.
Many {CFD} simulations were performed to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull and appendages in a range of flow directions, rudder angles and rotating flow. Those simulations encompass the whole range of datapoints needed to describe a wind-assisted ship during manoeuvring.
Taking into consideration both hydrodynamic characteristics and manoeuvrability effects at an early design stage can reduce model tests costs and will allow to inspect a larger number of hull-appendages scenarios when analysing the final {VPP} results.},

	title = {{THESIS} {FOR} {THE} {DEGREE} {OF} {LICENTIATE} {OF} {ENGINEERING} Rigid Body Ship Dynamics System Identification in Calm Waters},
	abstract = {It is common today that operational data is recorded onboard ships within the Internet
of Ships ({IoS}) paradigm. This enables the possibility to build ship digital twins as
digital copies of the real ships. Predicting the ship’s motions with ship dynamics could
be an important sub-component of these ship digital twins. A model for the ship’s
dynamics can be identified based on observations of the ship’s motions. The identified
model will have model uncertainty due to imperfections and idealizations made in
physical model formulations as well as uncertainty from errors in the measurement
data, which can be very pronounced when using full scale operational data. It is
easier to develop accurate models with low model uncertainty using data obtained in
a controlled laboratory environment where the measurement errors are much lower,
especially in calm water conditions. The prediction model should be able to describe
scenarios that a ship has never encountered before, which is possible if much of the
underlying physics has been identified. Grey-box modelling is a technique which
combines operational data with physical principles to achieve this.
The objective of this thesis is to develop system identification methods for grey
box models with good generalization of the model scale rigid body ship dynamics in
calm waters.
A model development procedure is proposed to handle the model uncertainty
through the selection of candidate models based on a hold-out evaluation procedure.
The measurement noise is handled by an iterative preprocessor, which uses an extended
Kalman filter ({EKF}) and a Rauch Tung Striebel ({RTS}) smoother that uses an initially
estimated predictor model from semi-empirical formulas.
It is demonstrated that the ship’s roll motion with high accuracy can be described
using a quadratic damping model. For the more complex manoeuvring models,
multicollinearity is a large problem where the appropriate complexity needs to be
selected with the bias-variance trade-off between underfitting or overfitting the data.
Hold-out turning circle tests were predicted with high accuracy for the {wPCC} and
{KVLCC}2 test case ships with models from the proposed development procedure and
parameter estimation method.
The proposed methods can produce prediction models with high generalization
given that a suitable model structure has been selected from the candidate models
and an appropriate split in the hold-out evaluation of the model development process
has been applied.},

	abstract = {Demanding marine operations increase the complexity of maneuvering. A highly accurate dynamic ship model promotes predicting ship motions and advancing control safety for the offshore ship systems. It is crucial to identify the uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients under environmental disturbance to establish accurate mathematical models. In this paper, the identification procedure for a 3 degree of freedom hydrodynamic model under disturbance is completed based on the support vector machine method with multiple maneuvers datasets. The algorithm is validated on the clean ship model and the results present good fitness with the reference. Experiments in different sea states are designed and conducted to investigate the effects of the turbulence on the identified model fidelity. Generalization results show that the models identified in the gentle and moderate environments have less than 10\% deviations and are considered allowable. The higher perturbations, the lower fidelity of the identified model. Models identified under disturbance could provide different levels of reliable support for the operation decision system.},

The goodness of the two estimated models for describing a merchant ship’s manoeuvrability is first studied using her manoeuvring simulation data. Then, experimental manoeuvring tests to use a {USV} in open water with wind and drifting effects are used to check the conventional model identification procedures.

Potential flow-based analysis presents such a solution for seakeeping analyses. The accuracy of roll motion in potential flow is however not so good, due to the large influence from vicsous roll damping, which is missing in these calculations. This paper proposes a hybrid method, as a solution to this problem , where the viscous roll damping from Ikeda's semi-empirical method is injected into an existing 3D unsteady fully nonlinear potential flow ({FNPF}) method. The hybrid method is investigated using roll decay tests with the {KVLCC}2 test case. This investigation shows that the accuracy of simulated roll motions is significantly improved and also shows good agreement with the corresponding roll decay model tests.},

	abstract = {Maritime transport plays a vital role in economic development. To establish a vessel scheduling model, accurate ship maneuvering models should be used to optimize the strategy and maximize the economic beneﬁts. The use of nonparametric modeling techniques to identify ship maneuvering systems has attracted considerable attention. The Gaussian process has high precision and strong generalization ability in ﬁtting nonlinear functions and requires less training data, which is suitable for ship dynamic model identiﬁcation. Compared with other machine learning methods, the most obvious advantage of the Gaussian process is that it can provide the uncertainty of prediction. However, most studies on ship modeling and prediction do not consider the uncertainty propagation in Gaussian processes. In this paper, a moment-matching-based approach is applied to address the problem. The proposed identiﬁcation scheme for ship maneuvering systems is veriﬁed by container ship simulation data and experimental data from the Workshop on Veriﬁcation and Validation of Ship Maneuvering Simulation Methods ({SIMMAN}) database. The results indicate that the identiﬁed model is accurate and shows good generalization performance. The uncertainty of ship motion prediction is well considered based on the uncertainty propagation technology.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the fundamental properties associated with the Nomoto models. Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification. Thus, appropriate model structures can be selected according to the intended frequency range of application to meet the modeling accuracy requirements.},

The time series used in training the network are obtained from simulated data of zigzag maneuvers and the proposed method has been applied to these data. The neural network scheme adopted in this work has one middle or hidden layer of neurons and it employs the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.

Examples considered include the forecasting of the seastate elevations and vessel responses using their past time records as “explanatory variables” or “features” and the development of a nonlinear model for the roll restoring, added moment of inertia and viscous damping using the vessel response kinematics from free decay tests as “features”. A key innovation of {AI}-{SVM} kernel algorithms is that the nonlinear dependence of the dependent variable on the “features” is embedded into the {SVM} kernel and its selection plays a key role in the performance of the algorithms. The kernel selection is discussed and its relation to the physics of the marine hydrodynamic flows considered in the present paper is addressed.},

	abstract = {Inverse dynamics is a technique in which measured kinematics and, possibly, external forces are used to calculate net joint torques in a rigid body linked segment model. However, kinematics and forces are usually not consistent due to incorrect modelling assumptions and measurement errors. This is commonly resolved by introducing ‘residual forces and torques’ which compensate for this problem, but do not exist in reality. In this study a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed that finds the kinematics that are mechanically consistent with measured external forces and mimic the measured kinematics as closely as possible. The algorithm was tested on datasets containing planar kinematics and ground reaction forces obtained during human walking at three velocities (0.8 m/s, 1.25 and 1.8 m/s). Before optimization, the residual force and torque were calculated for a typical example. Both showed substantial values, indicating the necessity of developing a mechanically consistent algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm converged to a solution in which the residual forces and torques were zero, without changing the ground reaction forces and with only minor changes to the measured kinematics. When using a rigid body approach, our algorithm ensures a consistent description of forces and kinematics, thereby improving the validity of calculated net joint torque and power values.},

	abstract = {Maneuverability is an important hydrodynamic performance of a ship, and should be taken into account during the ship design stage. The present study of Computational Fluid Dynamic ({CFD}) calculations aims to offer a numerical tool for maneuvering prediction with high accuracy. The virtual captive model tests for a model scale {KCS} container ship are conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes ({RANS}) computation to obtain the full set of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives in the 3rd-order Abkowitz model. The numerical uncertainty analysis is carried out for the pure sway and yaw-drift tests to verify the numerical accuracy. It is concluded that the lower order Fourier coefficients are preferred in the computation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. Moreover, part of the computed hydrodynamic forces and moments are compared with the available captive model test data, and good agreement is obtained. By substituting the computed hydrodynamic derivatives into the mathematical model, the standard turning and zigzag maneuvers are predicted. By comparing the predicted maneuvering results with the available experimental data and the prediction results by others, it is demonstrated that acceptable prediction accuracy can be achieved with the present method, which shows the effectiveness of the present method in predicting ship maneuverability. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {To obtain an accurate ship maneuverability model for motion prediction and autonomous navigation, a ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction method is proposed based on Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}). A Mathematical Model Group ({MMG}) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test ({OTT}) and dynamic Circular Motion Test ({CMT}) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the {MMG} model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes ({RANS}) equations. The {MMG} hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom {MMG} model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard {KRISO} Container Ship ({KCS}).

	abstract = {System identification is the art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input–output data. It can be seen as the interface between the real world of applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions. As such, it is an ubiquitous necessity for successful applications. System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc. At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there are many approaches and methods. A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible. Instead, this presentation aims at giving an overview of the “science” side, i.e. basic principles and results and at pointing to open problem areas in the practical, “art”, side of how to approach and solve a real problem.},

	abstract = {Identifying the ship’s maneuvering dynamics can build models for ship maneuverability predictions with a wide range of useful applications. A majority of the publications in this field are based on simulated data. In this paper model test data is used. The identification process can be decomposed into finding a suitable manoeuvring model for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. A parameter estimation is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable manoeuvring model is found using the parameter estimation with cross-validation on a set of competing manoeuvring models. The parameter estimation uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) with a Rauch Tung Striebel ({RTS}) smoother. Two case study vessels, {wPCC} and {KVLCC}2, with very different maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method. Turning circle predictions with the robust manoeuvring models, trained on zigzag model tests, show good agreement with the corresponding model test results for both ships.},

	abstract = {The need to reduce green-house gas emissions from shipping has reborn the interest in wind propulsion for commercial cargo vessels. This places new requirements on the tools used in ship design, as well as the methods usually applied in sailing yacht design. A range of design tools are used by designers at various stages in the design of wind-assisted ships and for different purposes. One important tool is the steady-state velocity prediction program ({VPP}) which is typically used to predict the speed of the vessel when sailing in a range of wind directions and wind speeds. Steady-state {VPPs} can be very efficient and fast and may be used to rapidly assess a large number of design alternatives. However, steady-state {VPPs} are not able to consider dynamic effects such as unsteady wave forces on the hull which may require the rudder to be active to control the heading and course of the vessel. This, in turn, leads to different mean forces than those predicted by a static {VPP} and therefore the sailing performance may be reduced compared to the predictions of a static {VPP}. Another effect of the ship’s motions in a seaway is that the angles of attack of the sails fluctuate, which can lead to different optimum sheeting angles and possibly a loss of performance. This study uses an unsteady 3D fully nonlinear potential flow hydrodynamic model coupled with an efficient lifting-line aerodynamic model to investigate the differences in sailing performance of a vessel sailing in steady conditions to the performance when sailing in a seaway and gusty wind based on a spatio-temporal wind model. The analysis shows clearly that the unsteady wind model affects the predicted performance. This is especially the case when sailing close-hauled and on a beam reach, where large changes in the local sail angles of attack can be observed.},

The measurement system is a custom-designed towing tank maneuvering test flow-mapping system, which features a {PMM} for captive model testing with an integrated stereoscopic {PIV}. Statistical convergence error is defined and monitored by using the confidence intervals of the mean and variance. The quality of data is also assessed by following standard uncertainty assessment procedures. The present experimental data are cross-referenced with computational simulations for identification of the major vortices in the flow. The core locations and trajectories of the major vortices are traced and the flow variables at the core locations are analyzed.

The mathematical model with the improved parameters shows much better agreement with experiments in both calm water and waves than the original mathematical model.

	abstract = {System identification of vessel steering associated with unstructured uncertainties is considered in this paper. The initial model of vessel steering is derived by a modified second-order Nomoto model (i.e., nonlinear vessel steering with stochastic state-parameter conditions). However, that model introduces various difficulties in system identification, due to the presence of a large number of states and parameters and system nonlinearities. Therefore, partial feedback linearization is proposed to simplify the proposed model, where the system-model unstructured uncertainties can also be separated. Furthermore, partial feedback linearization reduces the number of states and parameters and the system nonlinearities, given the resulting reduced-order state model. Then, the system identification approach is carried out, for both models (i.e., full state model and reduced-order state model), resorting to an extended Kalman filter ({EKF}). As illustrated in the results, the reduced-order model was able to successfully identify the required states and parameters when compared to the full state model in vessel steering under persistent excitation maneuvers. Therefore, the proposed approach can be used in a wide range of system identification applications.},

This approach combines hydrodynamic terms from classical models to form a priori dictionary and utilizes the sequential thresholded least-squares ({STLS}) algorithm and Bayesian optimization to identify model counterparts and adaptively optimize the hyperparameters. The proposed method was validated using {KVLCC}2 ship experimental data, {NPS}-{AUV} simulation data and Star Ocean {II} {AUV} experimental data, and it can achieve both high accuracy and good interpretability with low complexity.

These techniques are described in the book, together with their theoretical and mathematical underlying principles. Domain-independent methods, such as following energy flows in bond graphs gives a useful background for understanding object oriented modeling. Both classical state-space models and general differential algebraic equations ({DAE}) are treated.The book also gives a comprehensive treatment of system identification, that is, techniques to estimate mathematical models from measured system inputs and outputs. Both linear and nonlinear models are treated, including artificial neural networks.The text is related to the Swedish text Modellbygge och Simulering, Studentlitteratur, 2003.

	title = {Power Allocation Influence on Energy Consumption of a Double-Ended Ferry},
	abstract = {Fuel is one of the highest cost items while operating a ship, and its combustion results in air emissions polluting environments. Finding ways to increase shipping operations efficiency without compromising the provided service quality is necessary for economic and environmental reasons. This study first used data analysis to find hidden information in one-year navigation data of a double-ended ferry operated along the Swedish coast. The case study ferry was operated using both bow and stern engines partly loaded. A new feature of the power ratio is defined to describe the influence of engine power allocation on total fuel consumption. Then, different machine learning methods are used to establish the ship's total fuel consumption model due to influences of external factors such as wind and sea currents, etc., together with the power ratio. The established machine learning model is used to find the most efficient operation of allocating power to different engines. It shows that, in theory, up to 35\% fuel savings can be achieved for the case study vessel. These findings can further aid with the operational planning for the scope of Eco-driving.Double-ended ferries are an alternative to bridges or tunnels for transporting passengers and cars over water. They are used for commuting in big cities like New York (Siferry 2022), London ({TRL} 2022), and connecting islands along the coast. Double-ended ferries can achieve this task on short routes where maneuverability may be difficult (Waterhouse, 2016), and relieve road congestion (Leung et al., 2017). The objective in maritime transport is to reduce {CO}2 emissions by at least 40\% by 2030 and to pursue efforts to reach 70\% reduction by 2050, compared to the 2008 setup by {IMO} (2018). Maritime authorities also push regional ferries to become more environmentally friendly and save fuel costs. It becomes important to investigate how to operate these vessels to reduce energy consumption. For this purpose, a fundamental problem is establishing a reliable performance model to describe those ferries' fuel consumption in terms of their operational profiles, such as allocation of engine load, ship speed, etc. Different models have been researched in the maritime community to address this problem.},

	title = {Propeller-Hull Interaction Effects in Calm Water and Regular Head Waves},
	url = {https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/539753},
	abstract = {In order to design fuel-efficient ships and install compatible propulsion systems, ship and propeller designers need to know the potential effects of the interactions between different ship components, e.g., hull, propeller, appendages and machinery, on the ship performance at sea. Neglecting the interaction effects may result in unbalanced powering which adversely affects the energy/fuel consumption, hence increasing ships operational cost and environmental impact. Developing accurate and reliable engineering methods that can predict the ships required power considering the interaction effects, can be an important contribution to achieve the aforementioned needs of the shipping industry. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Traditionally, power prediction has been carried out for ships operating in calm water rather than more realistic environmental conditions. However, waves can play a crucial role on the ship performance at sea. The interactions between waves, hull and the propulsion system of a ship may significantly affect the ship motions, resistance, wake, speed and propeller/engine load in comparison to calm water operational conditions. Nonetheless, it is practically impossible to take all of the entailed interactions between different ship components into consideration within the process of power prediction in all possible operational and environmental conditions, hence a series of assumptions and simplifications are often introduced. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}In this thesis, as a step towards the ship power prediction in more realistic environmental conditions, the propeller-hull interaction effects in a range of selective operational conditions in calm water and regular head waves are considered in model-scale. The main objective is to perform numerical investigations of the ship performance in these conditions, aiming at understanding the involved flow physics in the propeller-hull interaction effects on the ship behavior and its propulsion characteristics. The investigations in both calm water and regular head waves are carried out in three distinctive steps: only the bare hull consideration, only the propeller consideration known as propeller open water ({POW}) and finally, for the self-propelled hull. The bare hull investigations incorporate employing two computational methods: a Fully Nonlinear Potential Flow ({FNPF}) panel method and a state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) method using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes ({RANS}) approach. However, for the {POW} and self-propulsion studies only the {RANS} approach is employed. A formal verification and validation (V\&amp;V) procedure is applied to understand and control the numerical and modeling errors in the {RANS} computations. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Overall, the results of the employed numerical methods were in good agreement with the experimental data. The analysis of the results provided valuable insight into the ship and propeller hydrodynamic performance in terms of the ship motions, resistance, wake, propeller characteristics and the correlations between them. The ship hydrodynamics analyses from this thesis can shed more light onto the propeller-hull interaction effects in waves and help the ship/propeller designers optimize their designs for more realistic conditions than only calm water.},

	abstract = {Model-scale measurements and full-scale sea trials were compared to numerical simulations of different ship maneuvers. Simulations were performed using codes that solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes ({RANS}) equations coupled with the nonlinear rigid body equations of motion. Different time scales existing between ship motions and fluid flow as well as diverging spatial discretizations of hull and propulsor in conjunction with the propulsor’s rotation increased the required computational efforts, rendering the model unsuitable for comprehensive parametric investigations. To overcome these difficulties, a mixture between mesh morphing for small-scale motions and global displacement of the mesh for large-scale motions was developed. Previous investigations mostly replicated captive model tests or resolved the viscous flow more precisely to explore various dedicated effects. {RANS} simulations offer valuable insight into scale effects involved in maneuvering prediction as they allow the study of both ship and model scale flows. This paper explores the reliability of both direct maneuvering simulation (using a combination of a freely moving ship including the rotating propulsor) and simulations based upon the virtual replication of captive model tests (using Taylor-series expansions to model the external hydrodynamic forces). The influence of engine-propulsor interaction in maneuvering motion behavior and scale effects is discussed. Predictions are compared to model tests and sea trials.},

A Mathematical Model Group ({MMG}) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test ({OTT}) and dynamic Circular Motion Test ({CMT}) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the {MMG} model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes ({RANS}) equations. The {MMG} hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom {MMG} model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard {KRISO} Container Ship ({KCS}).

At the pre-processing stage, ship maneuvering prediction based on {CFD} codes solving the {RANSE} are with successful applications. However, the work of obtaining the hydrodynamic derivatives and maneuvering coefficients needs to deal with water surface effects and propeller rotating motion, which is very time-consuming. Thereby, it is necessary to explore an appropriate {CFD} application strategy for ship maneuvering prediction, to balance the numerical accuracy and time costs. In this paper, a self-built low-speed ship motion control experimental platform, ’{QiuXin} V’, modified from a harbor tug, is studied. Double-body assumption combined with discretized propeller method is adopted to perform series of virtual captive model tests and self propulsion tests, to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives, thruster performance, and maneuvering coefficients in straight moving conditions, while the flow attributes associated with the ducted thruster are predicted with empirical methods. Moreover, a modified steering force model is introduced to improve the maneuvering model accuracy. Non-disturbance turning and zigzag maneuvers are performed and compared with free-running model tests. Results show acceptable model accuracy and confirm the feasibility of the adopted integrated method in predicting the {ASD} ship maneuverability under low-speed conditions.},

The model tests were conducted using a ship model of length 3.057 m in a square tank at the National Research Institute of Fisheries Engineering, Japan. The wave conditions were as follows: the wave height was 3.6 m at full-scale, ratio of wavelength to ship length was 1.0, and the ship approached in the head wave direction before it was steered. The present method can simulate both the turning motion and wave-induced motions in regular waves with practical accuracy.},

	title = {Propellers performance in oblique flow},
	abstract = {The need for pollution reduction of commercial shipping might make the reintroduction of sail propulsion desirable. A ship under sail will travel with a drift angle due to the side forces created by the sail. This leads to non-axial inflow on the propeller, named oblique flow. The effect of oblique inflow on the propeller's performance has previously been researched for large angles up to 30. This paper outlines the effect for angles between 0 and 10, which was thus far unknown. A numerical model, that proved its applicability for large angles, was used. Results showed an increase for both dimensionless thrust and torque, {KT} \& {KQ}, which led to an increase of the propeller's performance. Also open water propeller tests, performed at the {TU} Delft, were conducted. Tests showed a more significant increase for all values than the model did. The model makes assumptions that led to an underestimation. Open water tests, conducted at a too low Reynolds number, resulted in an overestimation. Neither method is sufficient for estimation of the propeller's performance in oblique flow. We conclude that the truth lies somewhere in between both outcomes. For further analysis more open water tests need to be conducted at a higher Reynolds number to eliminate scale errors.},

	abstract = {Large propeller lateral loads may be generated under oblique flow condition, which is critical to the safety of stern tube bearing of a ship. In the present study, the effect of oblique flow on propeller lateral loads is numerically investigated based on {URANS} method, coupled with {SST} k-ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method. An 82, 000 {DWT} bulk carrier with a single right-handed screw is computed. Both open water and behind-hull conditions are simulated for a range of drift angles from −20 to 20°. The lateral loads in open water increase with the drift angle increasing in a slightly non-linear trend. However, the behind-hull results are quite different from that in open water. At behind-hull conditions, the horizontal loads monotonously, non-linearly increase as the drift angle increases, while the vertical loads peak at the −5 deg drift angle (corresponding to the transverse flow coming from the portside). In large drift angles, the behind-hull lateral loads reach a larger percentage of the axial loads compared with the open-water results. Scale effect is also investigated by simulating the behind-hull flows with three scales. It is revealed that the increase in scales causes a slight decrease on the horizontal loads independently of drift angles, while it causes a remarkable increase and decrease on the vertical components for positive and negative drift angles, respectively.},

Open deck areas, high stability characteristics, and a wide range of operating speeds are some of the strong sides of these vessels. The fact that few studies have been done on manoeuvring performance predictions of these types of ships has been the main source of motivation in conducting this study. A fast multihull form, Delft Catamaran 372 ({DC}372), has been selected for computational fluid dynamics ({CFD})-based system simulation application. {CFD} method has been subjected to a verification and validation (V\&V) process using the latest solution verification techniques and available comparison data in the literature. The computerized planar motion mechanism ({CPMM}) approach has been applied to determine all the necessary hydrodynamic derivatives stated in Abkowitz’s manoeuvring model. A new approach to analysis of manoeuvring performance of multihull vessels, discrete study of hull components ({DSHC}), has been introduced for the interpretation of manoeuvring coefficients. The dynamic manoeuvre system simulator ({DynaMaSS}) in which a waterjet and conventional steering/propulsion units ({SPUs}) are implemented, has been presented for the 20-degree turning circle ({TC}20) and 20/20 zigzag ({ZZ}20) manoeuvre simulations of {DC}372.

Initially, open water simulations are performed for the propeller model to replicate experimental open water curves and estimate parameters for the body force model. Next static drift, pure sway, and pure yaw simulations are performed using both overset and static mesh, from which hydrodynamic derivatives are calculated. Next, restricted water simulations are performed using overset mesh for the ship in a channel with defined width and depth. Finally, manoeuvring derivatives are predicted for restricted waters and compared against the open water values.

The {PMM} experiments comprise both static test, i.e. oblique towing test, and dynamic tests, i.e. pure sway test, pure surge test, pure yaw test, and yaw test with constant drift angle. In order to obtain high-quality data, a band-pass filter was adopted to pass frequencies within a given range and attenuate high-frequency vibrations as well as background noises. Subsequently, a Fourier transform would be considered to evaluate the maneuvering derivatives based on their motion characteristics. It is worth to mention that the maneuvering derivatives derived from the static tests are in good agreement with the results published by the David Taylor Research Center ({DTRC}). In the view of steering efficiency, it is inclined to conduct rotation movement rather than transverse movement in {SUBOFF} operations by analyzing special maneuvering derivatives.},

This investigation aims, in particular, to mark off the confidence Interval of neglecting free surface deformation hypothesis by comparing the results of static drift test with and without considering this assumption. The study was carried on a 135 m inland containership at a scale ratio of 1:25 undergoing static drift tests.

The tests are performed by numerical code under the commercial software Ansys Fluent by solving Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equations({RANSE}) coupled to a \$\$k -{\textbackslash}omega\$\${SST} turbulence model. To investigate the effect of free surface modelling, the hydrodynamic forces are compared when the free surface separating air and water is considered, using Volume Of Fluid ({VOF}) method, and when the free surface is neglected.

Given the relevant impact, an enlarged captive model testing campaign executed on a sample of reference vessels was analysed to further characterise and extend the concepts to a broader class of modern single and twin-screw vessels, thus motivating the study.

	title = {Numerical and Experimental Study of Dynamic {PMM} tests of the {ONRT} Hull},
	abstract = {In this article, the numerical simulations and experimental tests are performed for the dynamic {PMM} tests of the {ONRT} hull. The {PMM} model tests are carried out in the towing tank of Marine Design and Research Institute of China ({MARIC}) and the numerical simulations are performed using the open-source {CFD} library {OpenFOAM}. Validations of the numerical methods are provided by comparison with experimental measurements. The grid convergence study is performed in the authors previous literature, which is based on several oblique towing tests of the {ONRT} hull and is also brieflyillustrated in this article. The numerical results show that, for dynamic {PMM} cases, the predicted amplitude of lateral force and yaw moment are smaller than the measured data and there is slight phase difference between numerical results and the experimental measurements. The calculated time changing longitudinal force is not consistent with the experimental data but the discrepancy between the mean value is reasonable.Similar phenomenon is also given in other literatures.},

	abstract = {In the present paper, the analysis of the turning capability of the naval supply vessel presented in Part I (Broglia et al., 2015) is continued with different stern appendages, namely twin rudder and centreline skeg. The main purpose of the analysis is to assess the capability of an in-house {CFD} tool in capturing the different manoeuvring characteristics of the ship hulls; the test case is challenging, as the difference between the two configurations lies in the complex flow structure related to rudder–propeller interactions. Moreover, although the twin rudder solution slightly improves the poor course keeping ability of the original vessel, the course stability remains poor and, consequently, large lateral motions and drift angle have to be expected during the manoeuvre. The manoeuvring capabilities of the new configuration are discussed and compared with the single rudder configuration, focusing on the nature of the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the main hull and appendages during the transient and stabilized phases of the manoeuvre. Emphasis will be also given to the different contributions of the propulsion system in the twin rudder configuration, that results from the different rudder–propeller interaction.},

The experiments are conducted in the {IIHR} towing tank as part of an international collaboration for development/application of uncertainty analysis procedures and assessment of scale effects and facility biases. Stationarity and normality tests and statistical convergence errors, single and multiple run methods for obtaining the maneuvering mathematical model hydrodynamic derivatives, and the effects of heave, pitch and roll motions and fixed/free mount conditions are assessed. Assessment of the methods for obtaining the hydrodynamic derivatives is based on reconstructions of the measured force and moment time histories. Part 2 presents phase-averaged stereo {PIV} flow field measurements. The data is used as a test case at the {SIMMAN} 2008 and 2014 workshops on verification and validation of ship maneuvering simulation methods.},
